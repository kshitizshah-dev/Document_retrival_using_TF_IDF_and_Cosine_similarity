Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an\\nindividual—he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom\\nI knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.\\n\\nThe odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and\\nslaves in the West at the period of this story—that is to say, thirty or\\nforty years ago.\\n\\nAlthough my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and\\ngirls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,\\nfor part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what\\nthey once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,\\nand what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.\\n\\nTHE AUTHOR.\\n\\nHARTFORD, 1876.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\n“Tom!”\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\n“TOM!”\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\n“What’s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!”\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\nThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the\\nroom; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or\\nnever looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were\\nher state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not\\nservice—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.\\nShe looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but\\nstill loud enough for the furniture to hear:\\n\\n“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll—”\\n\\nShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching\\nunder the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\\npunches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.\\n\\n“I never did see the beat of that boy!”\\n\\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the\\ntomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So\\nshe lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:\\n\\n“Y-o-u-u TOM!”\\n\\nThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize\\na small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\\n\\n“There! I might ’a’ thought of that closet. What you been doing in\\nthere?”\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that\\ntruck?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, aunt.”\\n\\n“Well, I know. It’s jam—that’s what it is. Forty times I’ve said if you\\ndidn’t let that jam alone I’d skin you. Hand me that switch.”\\n\\nThe switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—\\n\\n“My! Look behind you, aunt!”\\n\\nThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.\\nThe lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and\\ndisappeared over it.\\n\\nHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle\\nlaugh.\\n\\n“Hang the boy, can’t I never learn anything? Ain’t he played me tricks\\nenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old\\nfools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks,\\nas the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,\\nand how is a body to know what’s coming? He ’pears to know just how long\\nhe can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make\\nout to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all down again and\\nI can’t hit him a lick. I ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s\\nthe Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as\\nthe Good Book says. I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I\\nknow. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own dead\\nsister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him,\\nsomehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and\\nevery time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is\\nborn of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,\\nand I reckon it’s so. He’ll play hookey this evening,[*] and I’ll just\\nbe obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty hard\\nto make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he\\nhates work more than he hates anything else, and I’ve _got_ to do some\\nof my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination of the child.”\\n\\n[*] Southwestern for “afternoon”\\n\\nTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home\\nbarely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood\\nand split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time\\nto tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.\\nTom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through\\nwith his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,\\nand had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.\\n\\nWhile Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity\\noffered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and\\nvery deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like\\nmany other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she\\nwas endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low\\ncunning. Said she:\\n\\n“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes’m.”\\n\\n“Powerful warm, warn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes’m.”\\n\\n“Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”\\n\\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He\\nsearched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:\\n\\n“No’m—well, not very much.”\\n\\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:\\n\\n“But you ain’t too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect\\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing\\nthat that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew\\nwhere the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:\\n\\n“Some of us pumped on our heads—mine’s damp yet. See?”\\n\\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of\\ncircumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new\\ninspiration:\\n\\n“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to\\npump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”\\n\\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt\\ncollar was securely sewed.\\n\\n“Bother! Well, go ’long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey\\nand been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a\\nsinged cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. _This_ time.”\\n\\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom\\nhad stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\\n\\nBut Sidney said:\\n\\n“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread,\\nbut it’s black.”\\n\\n“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”\\n\\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\\n\\n“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”\\n\\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into\\nthe lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle\\ncarried white thread and the other black. He said:\\n\\n“She’d never noticed if it hadn’t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes\\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to\\ngee-miny she’d stick to one or t’other—I can’t keep the run of ’em. But\\nI bet you I’ll lam Sid for that. I’ll learn him!”\\n\\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well\\nthough—and loathed him.\\n\\nWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not\\nbecause his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a\\nman’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore\\nthem down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s\\nmisfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new\\ninterest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired\\nfrom a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It\\nconsisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,\\nproduced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short\\nintervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to\\ndo it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him\\nthe knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of\\nharmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer\\nfeels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep,\\nunalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the\\nastronomer.\\n\\nThe summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom\\nchecked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger\\nthan himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive\\ncuriosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy\\nwas well dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply\\nastounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth\\nroundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes\\non—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of\\nribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The\\nmore Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose\\nat his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to\\nhim to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only\\nsidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the\\ntime. Finally Tom said:\\n\\n“I can lick you!”\\n\\n“I’d like to see you try it.”\\n\\n“Well, I can do it.”\\n\\n“No you can’t, either.”\\n\\n“Yes I can.”\\n\\n“No you can’t.”\\n\\n“I can.”\\n\\n“You can’t.”\\n\\n“Can!”\\n\\n“Can’t!”\\n\\nAn uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:\\n\\n“What’s your name?”\\n\\n“’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.”\\n\\n“Well I ’low I’ll _make_ it my business.”\\n\\n“Well why don’t you?”\\n\\n“If you say much, I will.”\\n\\n“Much—much—_much_. There now.”\\n\\n“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick you with\\none hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.”\\n\\n“Well why don’t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.”\\n\\n“Well I _will_, if you fool with me.”\\n\\n“Oh yes—I’ve seen whole families in the same fix.”\\n\\n“Smarty! You think you’re _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, what a hat!”\\n\\n“You can lump that hat if you don’t like it. I dare you to knock it\\noff—and anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.”\\n\\n“You’re a liar!”\\n\\n“You’re another.”\\n\\n“You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t take it up.”\\n\\n“Aw—take a walk!”\\n\\n“Say—if you give me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce a rock\\noff’n your head.”\\n\\n“Oh, of _course_ you will.”\\n\\n“Well I _will_.”\\n\\n“Well why don’t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will\\nfor? Why don’t you _do_ it? It’s because you’re afraid.”\\n\\n“I _ain’t_ afraid.”\\n\\n“You are.”\\n\\n“I ain’t.”\\n\\n“You are.”\\n\\nAnother pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently\\nthey were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:\\n\\n“Get away from here!”\\n\\n“Go away yourself!”\\n\\n“I won’t.”\\n\\n“I won’t either.”\\n\\nSo they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both\\nshoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But\\nneither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and\\nflushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:\\n\\n“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can\\nthrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”\\n\\n“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger\\nthan he is—and what’s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.”\\n [Both brothers were imaginary.]\\n\\n“That’s a lie.”\\n\\n“_Your_ saying so don’t make it so.”\\n\\nTom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:\\n\\n“I dare you to step over that, and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand\\nup. Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal sheep.”\\n\\nThe new boy stepped over promptly, and said:\\n\\n“Now you said you’d do it, now let’s see you do it.”\\n\\n“Don’t you crowd me now; you better look out.”\\n\\n“Well, you _said_ you’d do it—why don’t you do it?”\\n\\n“By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.”\\n\\nThe new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out\\nwith derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys\\nwere rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and\\nfor the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\\nclothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves\\nwith dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the\\nfog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him\\nwith his fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he.\\n\\nThe boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying—mainly from rage.\\n\\n“Holler ’nuff!”—and the pounding went on.\\n\\nAt last the stranger got out a smothered “’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Now that’ll learn you. Better look out who you’re fooling with next\\ntime.”\\n\\nThe new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,\\nsnuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and\\nthreatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.”\\n To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and\\nas soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it\\nand hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like\\nan antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he\\nlived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the\\nenemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the\\nwindow and declined. At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom\\na bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but\\nhe said he “’lowed” to “lay” for that boy.\\n\\nHe got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in\\nat the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and\\nwhen she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his\\nSaturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its\\nfirmness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nSaturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and\\nfresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if\\nthe heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in\\nevery face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom\\nand the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond\\nthe village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far\\nenough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\\n\\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a\\nlong-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\\na deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board\\nfence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a\\nburden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost\\nplank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant\\nwhitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed\\nfence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at\\nthe gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from\\nthe town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but\\nnow it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at\\nthe pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there\\nwaiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,\\nskylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred\\nand fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an\\nhour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\\n\\n“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”\\n\\nJim shook his head and said:\\n\\n“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water\\nan’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’ Mars Tom gwine\\nto ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own\\nbusiness—she ’lowed _she’d_ ’tend to de whitewashin’.”\\n\\n“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks.\\nGimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won’t ever\\nknow.”\\n\\n“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me.\\n’Deed she would.”\\n\\n“_She_! She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the head with her\\nthimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but\\ntalk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a\\nmarvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”\\n\\nJim began to waver.\\n\\n“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”\\n\\n“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful\\n’fraid ole missis—”\\n\\n“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”\\n\\nJim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down\\nhis pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing\\ninterest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he\\nwas flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\\nwhitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with\\na slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.\\n\\nBut Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had\\nplanned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys\\nwould come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and\\nthey would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very\\nthought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and\\nexamined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange\\nof _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour\\nof pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and\\ngave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless\\nmoment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,\\nmagnificent inspiration.\\n\\nHe took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in\\nsight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\\ndreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his\\nheart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and\\ngiving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\\nding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As\\nhe drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned\\nfar over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp\\nand circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered\\nhimself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and\\nengine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own\\nhurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:\\n\\n“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he\\ndrew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\\n\\n“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened\\ndown his sides.\\n\\n“Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!\\nChow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles—for it was\\nrepresenting a forty-foot wheel.\\n\\n“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!”\\n The left hand began to describe circles.\\n\\n“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on\\nthe stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!\\nTing-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now!\\nCome—out with your spring-line—what’re you about there! Take a turn\\nround that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now—let her\\ngo! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!”\\n(trying the gauge-cocks).\\n\\nTom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared\\na moment and then said: “_Hi-Yi! You’re_ up a stump, ain’t you!”\\n\\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then\\nhe gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as\\nbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the\\napple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:\\n\\n“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”\\n\\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:\\n\\n“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”\\n\\n“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of\\ncourse you’d druther _work_—wouldn’t you? Course you would!”\\n\\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:\\n\\n“What do you call work?”\\n\\n“Why, ain’t _that_ work?”\\n\\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:\\n\\n“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom\\nSawyer.”\\n\\n“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you _like_ it?”\\n\\nThe brush continued to move.\\n\\n“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a\\nchance to whitewash a fence every day?”\\n\\nThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.\\nTom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the\\neffect—added a touch here and there—criticised the effect again—Ben\\nwatching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more\\nabsorbed. Presently he said:\\n\\n“Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.”\\n\\nTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:\\n\\n“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful\\nparticular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it\\nwas the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful\\nparticular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon\\nthere ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it\\nthe way it’s got to be done.”\\n\\n“No—is that so? Oh come, now—lemme just try. Only just a little—I’d let\\n_you_, if you was me, Tom.”\\n\\n“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted to do\\nit, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let\\nSid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence\\nand anything was to happen to it—”\\n\\n“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I’ll give you\\nthe core of my apple.”\\n\\n“Well, here—No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard—”\\n\\n“I’ll give you _all_ of it!”\\n\\nTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his\\nheart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the\\nsun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,\\ndangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more\\ninnocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every\\nlittle while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time\\nBen was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\\na kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in\\nfor a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour\\nafter hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a\\npoor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in\\nwealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\\nof a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool\\ncannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a\\nglass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,\\nsix fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a\\ndog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,\\nand a dilapidated old window sash.\\n\\nHe had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company—and\\nthe fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of\\nwhitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.\\n\\nTom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He\\nhad discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely,\\nthat in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary\\nto make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and\\nwise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have\\ncomprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,\\nand that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And\\nthis would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or\\nperforming on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing\\nMont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England\\nwho drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a\\ndaily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable\\nmoney; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn\\nit into work and then they would resign.\\n\\nThe boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place\\nin his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to\\nreport.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nTom presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an\\nopen window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,\\nbreakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer\\nair, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing\\nmurmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her\\nknitting—for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her\\nlap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had\\nthought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at\\nseeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He\\nsaid: “Mayn’t I go and play now, aunt?”\\n\\n“What, a’ready? How much have you done?”\\n\\n“It’s all done, aunt.”\\n\\n“Tom, don’t lie to me—I can’t bear it.”\\n\\n“I ain’t, aunt; it _is_ all done.”\\n\\nAunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for\\nherself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of\\nTom’s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and\\nnot only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a\\nstreak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Well, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can work when you’re a\\nmind to, Tom.” And then she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it’s\\npowerful seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. Well, go ’long and\\nplay; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”\\n\\nShe was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took\\nhim into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,\\nalong with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat\\ntook to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.\\nAnd while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a\\ndoughnut.\\n\\nThen he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway\\nthat led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and\\nthe air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a\\nhail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties\\nand sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,\\nand Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general\\nthing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at\\npeace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his\\nblack thread and getting him into trouble.\\n\\nTom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the\\nback of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach\\nof capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the\\nvillage, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict,\\naccording to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these\\narmies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two\\ngreat commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better\\nsuited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence\\nand conducted the field operations by orders delivered through\\naides-de-camp. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long and\\nhard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,\\nthe terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the\\nnecessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and\\nmarched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.\\n\\nAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new\\ngirl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow\\nhair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered\\npantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A\\ncertain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a\\nmemory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;\\nhe had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor\\nlittle evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had\\nconfessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest\\nboy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time\\nshe had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is\\ndone.\\n\\nHe worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had\\ndiscovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and\\nbegan to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win\\nher admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;\\nbut by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic\\nperformances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending\\nher way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,\\ngrieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a\\nmoment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great\\nsigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,\\nright away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she\\ndisappeared.\\n\\nThe boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and\\nthen shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as\\nif he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.\\nPresently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his\\nnose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,\\nin his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his\\nbare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped\\naway with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a\\nminute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next\\nhis heart—or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in\\nanatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.\\n\\nHe returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, “showing\\noff,” as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom\\ncomforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some\\nwindow, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode\\nhome reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.\\n\\nAll through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “what\\nhad got into the child.” He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and\\ndid not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his\\naunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:\\n\\n“Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes it.”\\n\\n“Well, Sid don’t torment a body the way you do. You’d be always into\\nthat sugar if I warn’t watching you.”\\n\\nPresently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,\\nreached for the sugar-bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was\\nwellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and\\nbroke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled\\nhis tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a\\nword, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she\\nasked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be\\nnothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch it.” He was\\nso brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old\\nlady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath\\nfrom over her spectacles. He said to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the\\nnext instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted\\nto strike again when Tom cried out:\\n\\n“Hold on, now, what ’er you belting _me_ for?—Sid broke it!”\\n\\nAunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when\\nshe got her tongue again, she only said:\\n\\n“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some\\nother audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”\\n\\nThen her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something\\nkind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a\\nconfession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.\\nSo she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.\\nTom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart\\nhis aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the\\nconsciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice\\nof none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,\\nthrough a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured\\nhimself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching\\none little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and\\ndie with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured\\nhimself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and\\nhis sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how\\nher tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back\\nher boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would\\nlie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose\\ngriefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of\\nthese dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;\\nand his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,\\nand ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to\\nhim was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any\\nworldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too\\nsacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced\\nin, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit\\nof one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness\\nout at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.\\n\\nHe wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate\\nplaces that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river\\ninvited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated\\nthe dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could\\nonly be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the\\nuncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.\\nHe got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal\\nfelicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she\\ncry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and\\ncomfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?\\nThis picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he\\nworked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and\\nvaried lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing\\nand departed in the darkness.\\n\\nAbout half-past nine or ten o’clock he came along the deserted street to\\nwhere the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\\nhis listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain\\nof a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the\\nfence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under\\nthat window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him\\ndown on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\\nhands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.\\nAnd thus he would die—out in the cold world, with no shelter over his\\nhomeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,\\nno loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And\\nthus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and\\noh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would\\nshe heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,\\nso untimely cut down?\\n\\nThe window went up, a maid-servant’s discordant voice profaned the holy\\ncalm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains!\\n\\nThe strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz\\nas of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\\nas of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the\\nfence and shot away in the gloom.\\n\\nNot long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his\\ndrenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he\\nhad any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,” he thought\\nbetter of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom’s eye.\\n\\nTom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental\\nnote of the omission.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nThe sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful\\nvillage like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family\\nworship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid\\ncourses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of\\noriginality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of\\nthe Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\\n\\nThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get\\nhis verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his\\nenergies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the\\nSermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.\\nAt the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,\\nbut no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human\\nthought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took\\nhis book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the\\nfog:\\n\\n“Blessed are the—a—a—”\\n\\n“Poor”—\\n\\n“Yes—poor; blessed are the poor—a—a—”\\n\\n“In spirit—”\\n\\n“In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they—they—”\\n\\n“_Theirs_—”\\n\\n“For _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom\\nof heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they—they—”\\n\\n“Sh—”\\n\\n“For they—a—”\\n\\n“S, H, A—”\\n\\n“For they S, H—Oh, I don’t know what it is!”\\n\\n“_Shall_!”\\n\\n“Oh, _shall_! for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall\\nmourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that\\nshall mourn, for they shall—a—shall _what_? Why don’t you tell me,\\nMary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”\\n\\n“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t\\ndo that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom,\\nyou’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice.\\nThere, now, that’s a good boy.”\\n\\n“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”\\n\\n“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”\\n\\n“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”\\n\\nAnd he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity\\nand prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a\\nshining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve\\nand a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system\\nshook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,\\nbut it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur\\nin that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a\\nweapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing\\nmystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the\\ncupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\\ncalled off to dress for Sunday-school.\\n\\nMary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went\\noutside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\\ndipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;\\npoured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen\\nand began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But\\nMary removed the towel and said:\\n\\n“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt\\nyou.”\\n\\nTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he\\nstood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath\\nand began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut\\nand groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of\\nsuds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from\\nthe towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped\\nshort at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\\nthere was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in\\nfront and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she\\nwas done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of\\ncolor, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls\\nwrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately\\nsmoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his\\nhair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his\\nown filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his\\nclothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were\\nsimply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his\\nwardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself;\\nshe buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt\\ncollar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with\\nhis speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and\\nuncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there\\nwas a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He\\nhoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she\\ncoated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought\\nthem out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do\\neverything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\\n\\n“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”\\n\\nSo he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three\\nchildren set out for Sunday-school—a place that Tom hated with his whole\\nheart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.\\n\\nSabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church\\nservice. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\\nand the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s\\nhigh-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;\\nthe edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board\\ntree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step\\nand accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\\n\\n“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“What’ll you take for her?”\\n\\n“What’ll you give?”\\n\\n“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”\\n\\n“Less see ’em.”\\n\\nTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.\\nThen Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some\\nsmall trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other\\nboys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten\\nor fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm\\nof clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started\\na quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,\\nelderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a\\nboy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy\\nturned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear\\nhim say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole\\nclass were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came\\nto recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but\\nhad to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each\\ngot his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\\non it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten\\nblue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red\\ntickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent\\ngave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy\\ntimes) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and\\napplication to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Doré Bible? And\\nyet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of\\ntwo years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once\\nrecited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his\\nmental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot\\nfrom that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great\\noccasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)\\nhad always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older\\npupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\\nlong enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes\\nwas a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so\\ngreat and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s\\nheart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple\\nof weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really\\nhungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\\nhad for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.\\n\\nIn due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with\\na closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\\nleaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent\\nmakes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as\\nnecessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\\nwho stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though\\nwhy, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music\\nis ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim\\ncreature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he\\nwore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears\\nand whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a\\nfence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the\\nwhole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a\\nspreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had\\nfringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion\\nof the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously\\nproduced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a\\nwall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very\\nsincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places\\nin such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that\\nunconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar\\nintonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this\\nfashion:\\n\\n“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as\\nyou can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that\\nis it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one\\nlittle girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I\\nam out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech\\nto the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it\\nmakes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a\\nplace like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so\\non. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a\\npattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\\n\\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights\\nand other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings\\nand whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of\\nisolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound\\nceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the\\nconclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\\n\\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was\\nmore or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied\\nby a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman\\nwith iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s\\nwife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of\\nchafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy\\nLawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this\\nsmall newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next\\nmoment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling\\nhair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to\\nfascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one\\nalloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that\\nrecord in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that\\nwere sweeping over it now.\\n\\nThe visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.\\nWalters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The\\nmiddle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one\\nthan the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children\\nhad ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made\\nof—and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,\\ntoo. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled,\\nand seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county\\ncourt-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these\\nreflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the\\nranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of\\ntheir own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\\nwith the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music\\nto his soul to hear the whisperings:\\n\\n“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say—look! he’s a going to\\nshake hands with him—he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you\\nwish you was Jeff?”\\n\\nMr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings\\nand activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging\\ndirections here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The\\nlibrarian “showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of\\nbooks and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority\\ndelights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over\\npupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers\\nat bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen\\nteachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of\\nauthority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers, of\\nboth sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was\\nbusiness that frequently had to be done over again two or three times\\n(with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various\\nways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air\\nwas thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it\\nall the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all\\nthe house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was\\n“showing off,” too.\\n\\nThere was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete,\\nand that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.\\nSeveral pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been\\naround among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,\\nto have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\\n\\nAnd now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with\\nnine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded\\na Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not\\nexpecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But\\nthere was no getting around it—here were the certified checks, and they\\nwere good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\\nthe Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from\\nheadquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and\\nso profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the\\njudicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\\nin place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that\\nsuffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they\\nthemselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to\\nTom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.\\nThese despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a\\nguileful snake in the grass.\\n\\nThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the\\nsuperintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked\\nsomewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him\\nthat there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,\\nperhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two\\nthousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would\\nstrain his capacity, without a doubt.\\n\\nAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in\\nher face—but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain\\ntroubled; next a dim suspicion came and went—came again; she watched;\\na furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was\\njealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most\\nof all (she thought).\\n\\nTom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath\\nwould hardly come, his heart quaked—partly because of the awful\\ngreatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would\\nhave liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The\\nJudge put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine little man, and\\nasked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:\\n\\n“Tom.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, not Tom—it is—”\\n\\n“Thomas.”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That’s very well.\\nBut you’ve another one I daresay, and you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?”\\n\\n“Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say\\nsir. You mustn’t forget your manners.”\\n\\n“Thomas Sawyer—sir.”\\n\\n“That’s it! That’s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two\\nthousand verses is a great many—very, very great many. And you never can\\nbe sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth\\nmore than anything there is in the world; it’s what makes great men\\nand good men; you’ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some\\nday, Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s all owing to the\\nprecious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood—it’s all owing to\\nmy dear teachers that taught me to learn—it’s all owing to the good\\nsuperintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a\\nbeautiful Bible—a splendid elegant Bible—to keep and have it all for my\\nown, always—it’s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will\\nsay, Thomas—and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand\\nverses—no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and\\nthis lady some of the things you’ve learned—no, I know you wouldn’t—for\\nwe are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names\\nof all the twelve disciples. Won’t you tell us the names of the first\\ntwo that were appointed?”\\n\\nTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,\\nnow, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said\\nto himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest\\nquestion—why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up\\nand say:\\n\\n“Answer the gentleman, Thomas—don’t be afraid.”\\n\\nTom still hung fire.\\n\\n“Now I know you’ll tell me,” said the lady. “The names of the first two\\ndisciples were—”\\n\\n“_David and Goliah!_”\\n\\nLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nAbout half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,\\nand presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The\\nSunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and\\noccupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt\\nPolly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her—Tom being placed next\\nthe aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window\\nand the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up\\nthe aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;\\nthe mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other\\nunnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair,\\nsmart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill\\nmansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much\\nthe most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could\\nboast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the\\nnew notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by\\na troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all\\nthe young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule\\nsucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering\\nadmirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came\\nthe Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as\\nif she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was\\nthe pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so\\ngood. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His\\nwhite handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on\\nSundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys\\nwho had as snobs.\\n\\nThe congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,\\nto warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the\\nchurch which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the\\nchoir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all\\nthrough service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,\\nbut I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,\\nand I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in\\nsome foreign country.\\n\\nThe minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a\\npeculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His\\nvoice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a\\ncertain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word\\nand then plunged down as if from a spring-board:\\n\\n  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry _beds_\\n                                                        of ease,\\n\\n  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ _blood_\\n                                                        -y seas?\\n\\nHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was\\nalways called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies\\nwould lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,\\nand “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words\\ncannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal\\nearth.”\\n\\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into\\na bulletin-board, and read off “notices” of meetings and societies and\\nthings till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of\\ndoom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,\\naway here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is\\nto justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.\\n\\nAnd now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went\\ninto details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the\\nchurch; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;\\nfor the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United\\nStates; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the\\nPresident; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed\\nby stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of\\nEuropean monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\\nand the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear\\nwithal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with\\na supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace\\nand favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a\\ngrateful harvest of good. Amen.\\n\\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.\\nThe boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he\\nonly endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;\\nhe kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not\\nlistening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular\\nroute over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\\nhis ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered\\nadditions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had\\nlit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by\\ncalmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and\\npolishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with\\nthe body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping\\nits wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they\\nhad been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if\\nit knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s\\nhands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would\\nbe instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going\\non. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal\\nforward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of\\nwar. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.\\n\\nThe minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an\\nargument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and\\nyet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and\\nthinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly\\nworth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he\\nalways knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything\\nelse about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested\\nfor a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the\\nassembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion\\nand the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead\\nthem. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle\\nwere lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the\\nprincipal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the\\nthought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,\\nif it was a tame lion.\\n\\nNow he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\\nPresently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was\\na large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It\\nwas in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to\\ntake him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went\\nfloundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went\\ninto the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,\\nunable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\\nof his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in\\nthe beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came\\nidling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the\\nquiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the\\ndrooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around\\nit; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew\\nbolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly\\nsnatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\\nthe diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,\\nand continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent\\nand absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin\\ndescended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,\\na flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards\\naway, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators\\nshook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and\\nhand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,\\nand probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a\\ncraving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on\\nit again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his\\nfore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at\\nit with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But\\nhe grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a\\nfly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close\\nto the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the\\nbeetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony\\nand the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so\\ndid the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew\\ndown the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the\\nhome-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was\\nbut a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of\\nlight. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang\\ninto its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of\\ndistress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.\\n\\nBy this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with\\nsuppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.\\nThe discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all\\npossibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest\\nsentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of\\nunholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson\\nhad said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole\\ncongregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.\\n\\nTom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was\\nsome satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety\\nin it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog\\nshould play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in\\nhim to carry it off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nMonday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found\\nhim so—because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He\\ngenerally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,\\nit made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.\\n\\nTom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was\\nsick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.\\nHe canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated\\nagain. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he\\nbegan to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew\\nfeeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly\\nhe discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This\\nwas lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he\\ncalled it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that\\nargument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought\\nhe would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.\\nNothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing\\nthe doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or\\nthree weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly\\ndrew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.\\nBut now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed\\nwell worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable\\nspirit.\\n\\nBut Sid slept on unconscious.\\n\\nTom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.\\n\\nNo result from Sid.\\n\\nTom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then\\nswelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.\\n\\nSid snored on.\\n\\nTom was aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” and shook him. This course\\nworked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then\\nbrought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.\\nTom went on groaning. Sid said:\\n\\n“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,\\nTom?” And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.\\n\\nTom moaned out:\\n\\n“Oh, don’t, Sid. Don’t joggle me.”\\n\\n“Why, what’s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.”\\n\\n“No—never mind. It’ll be over by and by, maybe. Don’t call anybody.”\\n\\n“But I must! _Don’t_ groan so, Tom, it’s awful. How long you been this\\nway?”\\n\\n“Hours. Ouch! Oh, don’t stir so, Sid, you’ll kill me.”\\n\\n“Tom, why didn’t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don’t!_ It makes my flesh\\ncrawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?”\\n\\n“I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you’ve ever done to\\nme. When I’m gone—”\\n\\n“Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying, are you? Don’t, Tom—oh, don’t. Maybe—”\\n\\n“I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell ’em so, Sid. And Sid, you give\\nmy window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that’s come to\\ntown, and tell her—”\\n\\nBut Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,\\nnow, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had\\ngathered quite a genuine tone.\\n\\nSid flew downstairs and said:\\n\\n“Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom’s dying!”\\n\\n“Dying!”\\n\\n“Yes’m. Don’t wait—come quick!”\\n\\n“Rubbage! I don’t believe it!”\\n\\nBut she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.\\nAnd her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the\\nbedside she gasped out:\\n\\n“You, Tom! Tom, what’s the matter with you?”\\n\\n“Oh, auntie, I’m—”\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you—what is the matter with you, child?”\\n\\n“Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!”\\n\\nThe old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a\\nlittle, then did both together. This restored her and she said:\\n\\n“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and\\nclimb out of this.”\\n\\nThe groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a\\nlittle foolish, and he said:\\n\\n“Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my\\ntooth at all.”\\n\\n“Your tooth, indeed! What’s the matter with your tooth?”\\n\\n“One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”\\n\\n“There, there, now, don’t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.\\nWell—your tooth _is_ loose, but you’re not going to die about that.\\nMary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”\\n\\nTom said:\\n\\n“Oh, please, auntie, don’t pull it out. It don’t hurt any more. I wish\\nI may never stir if it does. Please don’t, auntie. I don’t want to stay\\nhome from school.”\\n\\n“Oh, you don’t, don’t you? So all this row was because you thought you’d\\nget to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,\\nand you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your\\noutrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old\\nlady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom’s tooth with a loop\\nand tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and\\nsuddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s face. The tooth hung dangling\\nby the bedpost, now.\\n\\nBut all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after\\nbreakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his\\nupper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable\\nway. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;\\nand one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and\\nhomage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,\\nand shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain\\nwhich he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;\\nbut another boy said, “Sour grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled\\nhero.\\n\\nShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry\\nFinn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and\\ndreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless\\nand vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and\\ndelighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like\\nhim. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied\\nHuckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders\\nnot to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.\\nHuckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown\\nmen, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat\\nwas a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,\\nwhen he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons\\nfar down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of\\nthe trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged\\nin the dirt when not rolled up.\\n\\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps\\nin fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to\\nschool or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could\\ngo fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it\\nsuited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he\\npleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring\\nand the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor\\nput on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything\\nthat goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,\\nhampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.\\n\\nTom hailed the romantic outcast:\\n\\n“Hello, Huckleberry!”\\n\\n“Hello yourself, and see how you like it.”\\n\\n“What’s that you got?”\\n\\n“Dead cat.”\\n\\n“Lemme see him, Huck. My, he’s pretty stiff. Where’d you get him?”\\n\\n“Bought him off’n a boy.”\\n\\n“What did you give?”\\n\\n“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”\\n\\n“Where’d you get the blue ticket?”\\n\\n“Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.”\\n\\n“Say—what is dead cats good for, Huck?”\\n\\n“Good for? Cure warts with.”\\n\\n“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”\\n\\n“I bet you don’t. What is it?”\\n\\n“Why, spunk-water.”\\n\\n“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”\\n\\n“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”\\n\\n“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”\\n\\n“Who told you so!”\\n\\n“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny\\ntold Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the\\nnigger told me. There now!”\\n\\n“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I\\ndon’t know _him_. But I never see a nigger that _wouldn’t_ lie. Shucks!\\nNow you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”\\n\\n“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water\\nwas.”\\n\\n“In the daytime?”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n“With his face to the stump?”\\n\\n“Yes. Least I reckon so.”\\n\\n“Did he say anything?”\\n\\n“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”\\n\\n“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool\\nway as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all\\nby yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a\\nspunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the\\nstump and jam your hand in and say:\\n\\n    ‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,\\n    Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,’\\n\\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then\\nturn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.\\nBecause if you speak the charm’s busted.”\\n\\n“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner\\ndone.”\\n\\n“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this\\ntown; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work\\nspunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,\\nHuck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many\\nwarts. Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean.”\\n\\n“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”\\n\\n“Have you? What’s your way?”\\n\\n“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,\\nand then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig\\na hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the\\nmoon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece\\nthat’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to\\nfetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the\\nwart, and pretty soon off she comes.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you\\nsay ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better.\\nThat’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and\\nmost everywheres. But say—how do you cure ’em with dead cats?”\\n\\n“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ’long about\\nmidnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it’s\\nmidnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see\\n’em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ’em talk;\\nand when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ’em\\nand say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m\\ndone with ye!’ That’ll fetch _any_ wart.”\\n\\n“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”\\n\\n“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”\\n\\n“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”\\n\\n“Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own\\nself. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he\\ntook up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that\\nvery night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke\\nhis arm.”\\n\\n“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”\\n\\n“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right\\nstiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when\\nthey mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”\\n\\n“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”\\n\\n“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”\\n\\n“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”\\n\\n“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and\\n_then_ it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t\\nreckon.”\\n\\n“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”\\n\\n“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”\\n\\n“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”\\n\\n“Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me\\na-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says\\n‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window—but don’t you\\ntell.”\\n\\n“I won’t. I couldn’t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but\\nI’ll meow this time. Say—what’s that?”\\n\\n“Nothing but a tick.”\\n\\n“Where’d you get him?”\\n\\n“Out in the woods.”\\n\\n“What’ll you take for him?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. I don’t want to sell him.”\\n\\n“All right. It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”\\n\\n“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m\\nsatisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”\\n\\n“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted\\nto.”\\n\\n“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a\\npretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”\\n\\n“Say, Huck—I’ll give you my tooth for him.”\\n\\n“Less see it.”\\n\\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed\\nit wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:\\n\\n“Is it genuwyne?”\\n\\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\\n\\n“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”\\n\\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the\\npinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than\\nbefore.\\n\\nWhen Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in\\nbriskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He\\nhung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like\\nalacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom\\narm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The\\ninterruption roused him.\\n\\n“Thomas Sawyer!”\\n\\nTom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.\\n\\n“Sir!”\\n\\n“Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?”\\n\\nTom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of\\nyellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric\\nsympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the\\ngirls’ side of the school-house. He instantly said:\\n\\n“_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_”\\n\\nThe master’s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of\\nstudy ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his\\nmind. The master said:\\n\\n“You—you did what?”\\n\\n“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”\\n\\nThere was no mistaking the words.\\n\\n“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever\\nlistened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your\\njacket.”\\n\\nThe master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches\\nnotably diminished. Then the order followed:\\n\\n“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”\\n\\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but\\nin reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\\nof his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good\\nfortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched\\nherself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and\\nwhispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the\\nlong, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\\n\\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur\\nrose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal\\nfurtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him\\nand gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she\\ncautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it\\naway. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less\\nanimosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it\\nremain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The\\ngirl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw\\nsomething on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time\\nthe girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began\\nto manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,\\napparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt\\nto see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she\\ngave in and hesitatingly whispered:\\n\\n“Let me see it.”\\n\\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends\\nto it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s\\ninterest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything\\nelse. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:\\n\\n“It’s nice—make a man.”\\n\\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He\\ncould have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\\nshe was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:\\n\\n“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”\\n\\nTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed\\nthe spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:\\n\\n“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”\\n\\n“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”\\n\\n“Oh, will you? When?”\\n\\n“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”\\n\\n“I’ll stay if you will.”\\n\\n“Good—that’s a whack. What’s your name?”\\n\\n“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”\\n\\n“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me\\nTom, will you?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from\\nthe girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Oh, it ain’t anything.”\\n\\n“Yes it is.”\\n\\n“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”\\n\\n“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”\\n\\n“You’ll tell.”\\n\\n“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”\\n\\n“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”\\n\\n“No, I won’t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.”\\n\\n“Oh, _you_ don’t want to see!”\\n\\n“Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.” And she put her small hand\\nupon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in\\nearnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were\\nrevealed: “_I love you_.”\\n\\n“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and\\nlooked pleased, nevertheless.\\n\\nJust at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his\\near, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the\\nhouse and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles\\nfrom the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful\\nmoments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But\\nalthough Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.\\n\\nAs the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but\\nthe turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the\\nreading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and\\nturned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into\\ncontinents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and\\ngot “turned down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought\\nup at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\\nostentation for months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThe harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas\\nwandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed\\nto him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.\\nThere was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.\\nThe drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed\\nthe soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the\\nflaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a\\nshimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds\\nfloated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible\\nbut some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or\\nelse to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.\\nHis hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of\\ngratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively\\nthe percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on\\nthe long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that\\namounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when\\nhe started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and\\nmade him take a new direction.\\n\\nTom’s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and\\nnow he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in\\nan instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn\\nfriends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a\\npin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.\\nThe sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were\\ninterfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit\\nof the tick. So he put Joe’s slate on the desk and drew a line down the\\nmiddle of it from top to bottom.\\n\\n“Now,” said he, “as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and\\nI’ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,\\nyou’re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.”\\n\\n“All right, go ahead; start him up.”\\n\\nThe tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe\\nharassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This\\nchange of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with\\nabsorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the\\ntwo heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all\\nthings else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The\\ntick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as\\nanxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would\\nhave victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would\\nbe twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep\\npossession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too\\nstrong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in\\na moment. Said he:\\n\\n“Tom, you let him alone.”\\n\\n“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”\\n\\n“No, sir, it ain’t fair; you just let him alone.”\\n\\n“Blame it, I ain’t going to stir him much.”\\n\\n“Let him alone, I tell you.”\\n\\n“I won’t!”\\n\\n“You shall—he’s on my side of the line.”\\n\\n“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”\\n\\n“I don’t care whose tick he is—he’s on my side of the line, and you\\nsha’n’t touch him.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll just bet I will, though. He’s my tick and I’ll do what I\\nblame please with him, or die!”\\n\\nA tremendous whack came down on Tom’s shoulders, and its duplicate on\\nJoe’s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from\\nthe two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been\\ntoo absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile\\nbefore when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.\\nHe had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed\\nhis bit of variety to it.\\n\\nWhen school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered\\nin her ear:\\n\\n“Put on your bonnet and let on you’re going home; and when you get to\\nthe corner, give the rest of ’em the slip, and turn down through the\\nlane and come back. I’ll go the other way and come it over ’em the same\\nway.”\\n\\nSo the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with\\nanother. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and\\nwhen they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they\\nsat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil\\nand held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising\\nhouse. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.\\nTom was swimming in bliss. He said:\\n\\n“Do you love rats?”\\n\\n“No! I hate them!”\\n\\n“Well, I do, too—_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your\\nhead with a string.”\\n\\n“No, I don’t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”\\n\\n“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”\\n\\n“Do you? I’ve got some. I’ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give\\nit back to me.”\\n\\nThat was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs\\nagainst the bench in excess of contentment.\\n\\n“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.\\n\\n“Yes, and my pa’s going to take me again some time, if I’m good.”\\n\\n“I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. Church ain’t\\nshucks to a circus. There’s things going on at a circus all the time.\\nI’m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.”\\n\\n“Oh, are you! That will be nice. They’re so lovely, all spotted up.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s so. And they get slathers of money—most a dollar a day, Ben\\nRogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“Why, engaged to be married.”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Would you like to?”\\n\\n“I reckon so. I don’t know. What is it like?”\\n\\n“Like? Why it ain’t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won’t\\never have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that’s\\nall. Anybody can do it.”\\n\\n“Kiss? What do you kiss for?”\\n\\n“Why, that, you know, is to—well, they always do that.”\\n\\n“Everybody?”\\n\\n“Why, yes, everybody that’s in love with each other. Do you remember\\nwhat I wrote on the slate?”\\n\\n“Ye—yes.”\\n\\n“What was it?”\\n\\n“I sha’n’t tell you.”\\n\\n“Shall I tell _you_?”\\n\\n“Ye—yes—but some other time.”\\n\\n“No, now.”\\n\\n“No, not now—to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky—I’ll whisper it, I’ll whisper it ever so\\neasy.”\\n\\nBecky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about\\nher waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to\\nher ear. And then he added:\\n\\n“Now you whisper it to me—just the same.”\\n\\nShe resisted, for a while, and then said:\\n\\n“You turn your face away so you can’t see, and then I will. But you\\nmustn’t ever tell anybody—_will_ you, Tom? Now you won’t, _will_ you?”\\n\\n“No, indeed, indeed I won’t. Now, Becky.”\\n\\nHe turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred\\nhis curls and whispered, “I—love—you!”\\n\\nThen she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,\\nwith Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little\\nwhite apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:\\n\\n“Now, Becky, it’s all done—all over but the kiss. Don’t you be afraid\\nof that—it ain’t anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her\\napron and the hands.\\n\\nBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing\\nwith the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Now it’s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain’t\\never to love anybody but me, and you ain’t ever to marry anybody but me,\\never never and forever. Will you?”\\n\\n“No, I’ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I’ll never marry anybody\\nbut you—and you ain’t to ever marry anybody but me, either.”\\n\\n“Certainly. Of course. That’s _part_ of it. And always coming to school\\nor when we’re going home, you’re to walk with me, when there ain’t\\nanybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because\\nthat’s the way you do when you’re engaged.”\\n\\n“It’s so nice. I never heard of it before.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence—”\\n\\nThe big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.\\n\\n“Oh, Tom! Then I ain’t the first you’ve ever been engaged to!”\\n\\nThe child began to cry. Tom said:\\n\\n“Oh, don’t cry, Becky, I don’t care for her any more.”\\n\\n“Yes, you do, Tom—you know you do.”\\n\\nTom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and\\nturned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with\\nsoothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was\\nup, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and\\nuneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping\\nshe would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began\\nto feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle\\nwith him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and\\nentered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with\\nher face to the wall. Tom’s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a\\nmoment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:\\n\\n“Becky, I—I don’t care for anybody but you.”\\n\\nNo reply—but sobs.\\n\\n“Becky”—pleadingly. “Becky, won’t you say something?”\\n\\nMore sobs.\\n\\nTom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,\\nand passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:\\n\\n“Please, Becky, won’t you take it?”\\n\\nShe struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over\\nthe hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently\\nBecky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she\\nflew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:\\n\\n“Tom! Come back, Tom!”\\n\\nShe listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions\\nbut silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid\\nherself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she\\nhad to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross\\nof a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about\\nher to exchange sorrows with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nTom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the\\ntrack of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed\\na small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile\\nsuperstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later\\nhe was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff\\nHill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the\\nvalley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to\\nthe centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.\\nThere was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even\\nstilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken\\nby no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and\\nthis seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the\\nmore profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings\\nwere in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows\\non his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him\\nthat life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy\\nHodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie\\nand slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through\\nthe trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and\\nnothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a\\nclean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with\\nit all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant\\nthe best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. She\\nwould be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only\\ndie _temporarily_!\\n\\nBut the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained\\nshape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into\\nthe concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and\\ndisappeared mysteriously? What if he went away—ever so far away, into\\nunknown countries beyond the seas—and never came back any more! How\\nwould she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only\\nto fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights\\nwere an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was\\nexalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be\\na soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.\\nNo—better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on\\nthe warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the\\nFar West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with\\nfeathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy\\nsummer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs\\nof all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was\\nsomething gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!\\n_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable\\nsplendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!\\nHow gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,\\nblack-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying\\nat the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear\\nat the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in\\nhis black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson\\nsash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass\\nat his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,\\nwith the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy\\nthe whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the\\nSpanish Main!”\\n\\nYes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from\\nhome and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore\\nhe must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.\\nHe went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of\\nit with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He\\nput his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:\\n\\n“What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!”\\n\\nThen he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it\\nup and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides\\nwere of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was boundless!\\nHe scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\\n\\n“Well, that beats anything!”\\n\\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The\\ntruth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and\\nall his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried\\na marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a\\nfortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just\\nused, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered\\nthemselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been\\nseparated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.\\nTom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had\\nmany a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing\\nbefore. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times\\nbefore, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He\\npuzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch\\nhad interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself\\non that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot\\nwith a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and\\nput his mouth close to this depression and called—\\n\\n“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,\\ndoodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”\\n\\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a\\nsecond and then darted under again in a fright.\\n\\n“He dasn’t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”\\n\\nHe well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he\\ngave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have\\nthe marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a\\npatient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his\\ntreasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing\\nwhen he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his\\npocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:\\n\\n“Brother, go find your brother!”\\n\\nHe watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must\\nhave fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last\\nrepetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each\\nother.\\n\\nJust here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green\\naisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned\\na suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,\\ndisclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and\\nin a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,\\nwith fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an\\nanswering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way\\nand that. He said cautiously—to an imaginary company:\\n\\n“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”\\n\\nNow appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.\\nTom called:\\n\\n“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”\\n\\n“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—”\\n\\n“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by\\nthe book,” from memory.\\n\\n“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”\\n\\n“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”\\n\\n“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute\\nwith thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”\\n\\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,\\nstruck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful\\ncombat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:\\n\\n“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”\\n\\nSo they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and\\nby Tom shouted:\\n\\n“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”\\n\\n“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of\\nit.”\\n\\n“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the\\nbook. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy\\nof Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”\\n\\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the\\nwhack and fell.\\n\\n“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill _you_. That’s\\nfair.”\\n\\n“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”\\n\\n“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”\\n\\n“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam\\nme with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be\\nRobin Hood a little while and kill me.”\\n\\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then\\nTom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to\\nbleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,\\nrepresenting a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,\\ngave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow\\nfalls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he\\nshot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle\\nand sprang up too gaily for a corpse.\\n\\nThe boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off\\ngrieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern\\ncivilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.\\nThey said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than\\nPresident of the United States forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nAt half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.\\nThey said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and\\nwaited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be\\nnearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He\\nwould have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was\\nafraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.\\nEverything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,\\nscarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking\\nof the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack\\nmysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.\\nA measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the\\ntiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,\\nbegan. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the\\nbed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.\\nThen the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered\\nby a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last\\nhe was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to\\ndoze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear\\nit. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most\\nmelancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed\\nhim. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle\\nagainst the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a\\nsingle minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping\\nalong the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once\\nor twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence\\nto the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys\\nmoved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they\\nwere wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.\\n\\nIt was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,\\nabout a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence\\naround it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the\\ntime, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the\\nwhole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a\\ntombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over\\nthe graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory\\nof” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have\\nbeen read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.\\n\\nA faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the\\nspirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked\\nlittle, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the\\npervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the\\nsharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the\\nprotection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of\\nthe grave.\\n\\nThen they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of\\na distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom’s\\nreflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a\\nwhisper:\\n\\n“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”\\n\\nHuckleberry whispered:\\n\\n“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn like, _ain’t_ it?”\\n\\n“I bet it is.”\\n\\nThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter\\ninwardly. Then Tom whispered:\\n\\n“Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”\\n\\n“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”\\n\\nTom, after a pause:\\n\\n“I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody\\ncalls him Hoss.”\\n\\n“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead\\npeople, Tom.”\\n\\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\\n\\nPresently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:\\n\\n“Sh!”\\n\\n“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts.\\n\\n“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”\\n\\n“I—”\\n\\n“There! Now you hear it.”\\n\\n“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”\\n\\n“I dono. Think they’ll see us?”\\n\\n“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn’t\\ncome.”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing\\nany harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at\\nall.”\\n\\n“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”\\n\\n“Listen!”\\n\\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled\\nsound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\\n\\n“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”\\n\\n“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”\\n\\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an\\nold-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable\\nlittle spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a\\nshudder:\\n\\n“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners!\\nCan you pray?”\\n\\n“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I\\nlay me down to sleep, I—’”\\n\\n“Sh!”\\n\\n“What is it, Huck?”\\n\\n“They’re _humans_! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old Muff Potter’s\\nvoice.”\\n\\n“No—’tain’t so, is it?”\\n\\n“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to\\nnotice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”\\n\\n“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they\\ncome again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re\\np’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s\\nInjun Joe.”\\n\\n“That’s so—that murderin’ half-breed! I’d druther they was devils a dern\\nsight. What kin they be up to?”\\n\\nThe whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the\\ngrave and stood within a few feet of the boys’ hiding-place.\\n\\n“Here it is,” said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern\\nup and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.\\n\\nPotter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple\\nof shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.\\nThe doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat\\ndown with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the\\nboys could have touched him.\\n\\n“Hurry, men!” he said, in a low voice; “the moon might come out at any\\nmoment.”\\n\\nThey growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no\\nnoise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of\\nmould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon\\nthe coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two\\nthe men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with\\ntheir shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The\\nmoon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.\\nThe barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a\\nblanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large\\nspring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:\\n\\n“Now the cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, and you’ll just out with\\nanother five, or here she stays.”\\n\\n“That’s the talk!” said Injun Joe.\\n\\n“Look here, what does this mean?” said the doctor. “You required your\\npay in advance, and I’ve paid you.”\\n\\n“Yes, and you done more than that,” said Injun Joe, approaching the\\ndoctor, who was now standing. “Five years ago you drove me away from\\nyour father’s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to\\neat, and you said I warn’t there for any good; and when I swore I’d get\\neven with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for\\na vagrant. Did you think I’d forget? The Injun blood ain’t in me for\\nnothing. And now I’ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!”\\n\\nHe was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.\\nThe doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.\\nPotter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:\\n\\n“Here, now, don’t you hit my pard!” and the next moment he had grappled\\nwith the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,\\ntrampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe\\nsprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter’s\\nknife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about\\nthe combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung\\nhimself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams’ grave and felled\\nPotter to the earth with it—and in the same instant the half-breed saw\\nhis chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man’s breast. He\\nreeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in\\nthe same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the\\ntwo frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.\\n\\nPresently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the\\ntwo forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave\\na long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:\\n\\n“_That_ score is settled—damn you.”\\n\\nThen he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter’s\\nopen right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three—four—five\\nminutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed\\nupon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a\\nshudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and\\nthen around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s.\\n\\n“Lord, how is this, Joe?” he said.\\n\\n“It’s a dirty business,” said Joe, without moving.\\n\\n“What did you do it for?”\\n\\n“I! I never done it!”\\n\\n“Look here! That kind of talk won’t wash.”\\n\\nPotter trembled and grew white.\\n\\n“I thought I’d got sober. I’d no business to drink to-night. But it’s\\nin my head yet—worse’n when we started here. I’m all in a muddle;\\ncan’t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—_honest_, now,\\nold feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor, I\\nnever meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful—and him so\\nyoung and promising.”\\n\\n“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard\\nand you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering\\nlike, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched\\nyou another awful clip—and here you’ve laid, as dead as a wedge til\\nnow.”\\n\\n“Oh, I didn’t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I\\ndid. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.\\nI never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never\\nwith weepons. They’ll all say that. Joe, don’t tell! Say you won’t tell,\\nJoe—that’s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,\\ntoo. Don’t you remember? You _won’t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?” And the\\npoor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and\\nclasped his appealing hands.\\n\\n“No, you’ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I\\nwon’t go back on you. There, now, that’s as fair as a man can say.”\\n\\n“Oh, Joe, you’re an angel. I’ll bless you for this the longest day I\\nlive.” And Potter began to cry.\\n\\n“Come, now, that’s enough of that. This ain’t any time for blubbering.\\nYou be off yonder way and I’ll go this. Move, now, and don’t leave any\\ntracks behind you.”\\n\\nPotter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed\\nstood looking after him. He muttered:\\n\\n“If he’s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he\\nhad the look of being, he won’t think of the knife till he’s gone so\\nfar he’ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by\\nhimself—chicken-heart!”\\n\\nTwo or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the\\nlidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the\\nmoon’s. The stillness was complete again, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThe two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with\\nhorror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,\\napprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump\\nthat started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them\\ncatch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay\\nnear the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give\\nwings to their feet.\\n\\n“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!” whispered\\nTom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it much longer.”\\n\\nHuckleberry’s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed\\ntheir eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.\\nThey gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst\\nthrough the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering\\nshadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:\\n\\n“Huckleberry, what do you reckon’ll come of this?”\\n\\n“If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come of it.”\\n\\n“Do you though?”\\n\\n“Why, I _know_ it, Tom.”\\n\\nTom thought a while, then he said:\\n\\n“Who’ll tell? We?”\\n\\n“What are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe\\n_didn’t_ hang? Why, he’d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure\\nas we’re a laying here.”\\n\\n“That’s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.”\\n\\n“If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he’s fool enough. He’s\\ngenerally drunk enough.”\\n\\nTom said nothing—went on thinking. Presently he whispered:\\n\\n“Huck, Muff Potter don’t know it. How can he tell?”\\n\\n“What’s the reason he don’t know it?”\\n\\n“Because he’d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D’you reckon\\nhe could see anything? D’you reckon he knowed anything?”\\n\\n“By hokey, that’s so, Tom!”\\n\\n“And besides, look-a-here—maybe that whack done for _him_!”\\n\\n“No, ’taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and\\nbesides, he always has. Well, when pap’s full, you might take and belt\\nhim over the head with a church and you couldn’t phase him. He says so,\\nhis own self. So it’s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man\\nwas dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.”\\n\\nAfter another reflective silence, Tom said:\\n\\n“Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?”\\n\\n“Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn’t\\nmake any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak\\n’bout this and they didn’t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take\\nand swear to one another—that’s what we got to do—swear to keep mum.”\\n\\n“I’m agreed. It’s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear\\nthat we—”\\n\\n“Oh no, that wouldn’t do for this. That’s good enough for little\\nrubbishy common things—specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you\\nanyway, and blab if they get in a huff—but there orter be writing ’bout\\na big thing like this. And blood.”\\n\\nTom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;\\nthe hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.\\nHe picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a\\nlittle fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on\\nhis work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow\\ndown-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the\\npressure on the up-strokes.\\n\\n  “Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and\\n   They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell\\n   and Rot.”\\n\\nHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and\\nthe sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and\\nwas going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:\\n\\n“Hold on! Don’t do that. A pin’s brass. It might have verdigrease on\\nit.”\\n\\n“What’s verdigrease?”\\n\\n“It’s p’ison. That’s what it is. You just swaller some of it once—you’ll\\nsee.”\\n\\nSo Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked\\nthe ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after\\nmany squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his\\nlittle finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and\\nan F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the\\nwall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters\\nthat bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown\\naway.\\n\\nA figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined\\nbuilding, now, but they did not notice it.\\n\\n“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does this keep us from _ever_\\ntelling—_always_?”\\n\\n“Of course it does. It don’t make any difference _what_ happens, we got\\nto keep mum. We’d drop down dead—don’t _you_ know that?”\\n\\n“Yes, I reckon that’s so.”\\n\\nThey continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up\\na long, lugubrious howl just outside—within ten feet of them. The boys\\nclasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.\\n\\n“Which of us does he mean?” gasped Huckleberry.\\n\\n“I dono—peep through the crack. Quick!”\\n\\n“No, _you_, Tom!”\\n\\n“I can’t—I can’t _do_ it, Huck!”\\n\\n“Please, Tom. There ’tis again!”\\n\\n“Oh, lordy, I’m thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know his voice. It’s Bull\\nHarbison.” *\\n\\n[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of\\nhim as “Harbison’s Bull,” but a son or a dog of that name was “Bull\\nHarbison.”]\\n\\n“Oh, that’s good—I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I’d a bet\\nanything it was a _stray_ dog.”\\n\\nThe dog howled again. The boys’ hearts sank once more.\\n\\n“Oh, my! that ain’t no Bull Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “_Do_,\\nTom!”\\n\\nTom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His\\nwhisper was hardly audible when he said:\\n\\n“Oh, Huck, _it’s a stray dog_!”\\n\\n“Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?”\\n\\n“Huck, he must mean us both—we’re right together.”\\n\\n“Oh, Tom, I reckon we’re goners. I reckon there ain’t no mistake ’bout\\nwhere _I’ll_ go to. I been so wicked.”\\n\\n“Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a\\nfeller’s told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I’d a\\ntried—but no, I wouldn’t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,\\nI lay I’ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a\\nlittle.\\n\\n“_You_ bad!” and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom\\nSawyer, you’re just old pie, ’long-side o’ what I am. Oh, _lordy_,\\nlordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.”\\n\\nTom choked off and whispered:\\n\\n“Look, Hucky, look! He’s got his _back_ to us!”\\n\\nHucky looked, with joy in his heart.\\n\\n“Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?”\\n\\n“Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you\\nknow. _Now_ who can he mean?”\\n\\nThe howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.\\n\\n“Sh! What’s that?” he whispered.\\n\\n“Sounds like—like hogs grunting. No—it’s somebody snoring, Tom.”\\n\\n“That _is_ it! Where ’bouts is it, Huck?”\\n\\n“I bleeve it’s down at ’tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep\\nthere, sometimes, ’long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts\\nthings when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming back to\\nthis town any more.”\\n\\nThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys’ souls once more.\\n\\n“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I lead?”\\n\\n“I don’t like to, much. Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”\\n\\nTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the\\nboys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their\\nheels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,\\nthe one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the\\nsnorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man\\nmoaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was\\nMuff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,\\nwhen the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,\\nthrough the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance\\nto exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night\\nair again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few\\nfeet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose\\npointing heavenward.\\n\\n“Oh, geeminy, it’s _him_!” exclaimed both boys, in a breath.\\n\\n“Say, Tom—they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller’s\\nhouse, ’bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come\\nin and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there\\nain’t anybody dead there yet.”\\n\\n“Well, I know that. And suppose there ain’t. Didn’t Gracie Miller fall\\nin the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?”\\n\\n“Yes, but she ain’t _dead_. And what’s more, she’s getting better, too.”\\n\\n“All right, you wait and see. She’s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff\\nPotter’s a goner. That’s what the niggers say, and they know all about\\nthese kind of things, Huck.”\\n\\nThen they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window\\nthe night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and\\nfell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He\\nwas not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for\\nan hour.\\n\\nWhen Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the\\nlight, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not\\nbeen called—persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled\\nhim with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,\\nfeeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had\\nfinished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted\\neyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill\\nto the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it\\nwas up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into\\nsilence and let his heart sink down to the depths.\\n\\nAfter breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in\\nthe hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt\\nwept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;\\nand finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs\\nwith sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.\\nThis was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now\\nthan his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform\\nover and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that\\nhe had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble\\nconfidence.\\n\\nHe left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward\\nSid; and so the latter’s prompt retreat through the back gate was\\nunnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,\\nalong with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the\\nair of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to\\ntrifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his\\ndesk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony\\nstare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.\\nHis elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time\\nhe slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with\\na sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal\\nsigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!\\n\\nThis final feather broke the camel’s back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nClose upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified\\nwith the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;\\nthe tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,\\nwith little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave\\nholiday for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of\\nhim if he had not.\\n\\nA gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been\\nrecognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter—so the story ran. And\\nit was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself\\nin the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and that Potter\\nhad at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially the washing\\nwhich was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had\\nbeen ransacked for this “murderer” (the public are not slow in the\\nmatter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he\\ncould not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every\\ndirection, and the Sheriff “was confident” that he would be captured\\nbefore night.\\n\\nAll the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak\\nvanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not\\na thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,\\nunaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he\\nwormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.\\nIt seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched\\nhis arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry’s. Then both looked\\nelsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their\\nmutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly\\nspectacle before them.\\n\\n“Poor fellow!” “Poor young fellow!” “This ought to be a lesson to grave\\nrobbers!” “Muff Potter’ll hang for this if they catch him!” This was the\\ndrift of remark; and the minister said, “It was a judgment; His hand is\\nhere.”\\n\\nNow Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid\\nface of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,\\nand voices shouted, “It’s him! it’s him! he’s coming himself!”\\n\\n“Who? Who?” from twenty voices.\\n\\n“Muff Potter!”\\n\\n“Hallo, he’s stopped!—Look out, he’s turning! Don’t let him get away!”\\n\\nPeople in the branches of the trees over Tom’s head said he wasn’t\\ntrying to get away—he only looked doubtful and perplexed.\\n\\n“Infernal impudence!” said a bystander; “wanted to come and take a quiet\\nlook at his work, I reckon—didn’t expect any company.”\\n\\nThe crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously\\nleading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow’s face was haggard, and\\nhis eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the\\nmurdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands\\nand burst into tears.\\n\\n“I didn’t do it, friends,” he sobbed; “’pon my word and honor I never\\ndone it.”\\n\\n“Who’s accused you?” shouted a voice.\\n\\nThis shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around\\nhim with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n“Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you’d never—”\\n\\n“Is that your knife?” and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.\\n\\nPotter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the\\nground. Then he said:\\n\\n“Something told me ’t if I didn’t come back and get—” He shuddered; then\\nwaved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, “Tell ’em,\\nJoe, tell ’em—it ain’t any use any more.”\\n\\nThen Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the\\nstony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every\\nmoment that the clear sky would deliver God’s lightnings upon his head,\\nand wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had\\nfinished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to\\nbreak their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner’s life faded and\\nvanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and\\nit would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you leave? What did you want to come here for?” somebody\\nsaid.\\n\\n“I couldn’t help it—I couldn’t help it,” Potter moaned. “I wanted to\\nrun away, but I couldn’t seem to come anywhere but here.” And he fell to\\nsobbing again.\\n\\nInjun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes\\nafterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the\\nlightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that\\nJoe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most\\nbalefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could\\nnot take their fascinated eyes from his face.\\n\\nThey inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should\\noffer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.\\n\\nInjun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in\\na wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering\\ncrowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy\\ncircumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were\\ndisappointed, for more than one villager remarked:\\n\\n“It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.”\\n\\nTom’s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as\\nmuch as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:\\n\\n“Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me\\nawake half the time.”\\n\\nTom blanched and dropped his eyes.\\n\\n“It’s a bad sign,” said Aunt Polly, gravely. “What you got on your mind,\\nTom?”\\n\\n“Nothing. Nothing ’t I know of.” But the boy’s hand shook so that he\\nspilled his coffee.\\n\\n“And you do talk such stuff,” Sid said. “Last night you said, ‘It’s\\nblood, it’s blood, that’s what it is!’ You said that over and over.\\nAnd you said, ‘Don’t torment me so—I’ll tell!’ Tell _what_? What is it\\nyou’ll tell?”\\n\\nEverything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have\\nhappened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s face\\nand she came to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said:\\n\\n“Sho! It’s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night\\nmyself. Sometimes I dream it’s me that done it.”\\n\\nMary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.\\nTom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after\\nthat he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every\\nnight. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently\\nslipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good\\nwhile at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place\\nagain. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew\\nirksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of\\nTom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.\\n\\nIt seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding\\ninquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.\\nSid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,\\nthough it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;\\nhe noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness—and that was strange;\\nand Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion\\nto these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,\\nbut said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and\\nceased to torture Tom’s conscience.\\n\\nEvery day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his\\nopportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such\\nsmall comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of. The\\njail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge\\nof the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it\\nwas seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom’s\\nconscience.\\n\\nThe villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride\\nhim on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character\\nthat nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the\\nmatter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his\\ninquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery\\nthat preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in\\nthe courts at present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons why Tom’s mind had drifted away from its secret\\ntroubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest\\nitself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had\\nstruggled with his pride a few days, and tried to “whistle her down the\\nwind,” but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father’s\\nhouse, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she\\nshould die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an\\ninterest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there\\nwas nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;\\nthere was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to\\ntry all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who\\nare infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of\\nproducing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in\\nthese things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a\\nfever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,\\nbut on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the\\n“Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance\\nthey were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they\\ncontained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,\\nand what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and\\nwhat frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing\\nto wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her\\nhealth-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they\\nhad recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest\\nas the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered\\ntogether her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed\\nwith death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with\\n“hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an\\nangel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering\\nneighbors.\\n\\nThe water treatment was new, now, and Tom’s low condition was a windfall\\nto her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the\\nwood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed\\nhim down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she\\nrolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she\\nsweated his soul clean and “the yellow stains of it came through his\\npores”—as Tom said.\\n\\nYet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and\\npale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and\\nplunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the\\nwater with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his\\ncapacity as she would a jug’s, and filled him up every day with quack\\ncure-alls.\\n\\nTom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase\\nfilled the old lady’s heart with consternation. This indifference must\\nbe broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first\\ntime. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with\\ngratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water\\ntreatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.\\nShe gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the\\nresult. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;\\nfor the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not have shown a\\nwilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.\\n\\nTom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be\\nromantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have\\ntoo little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he\\nthought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of\\nprofessing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he\\nbecame a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and\\nquit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings\\nto alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle\\nclandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it\\ndid not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in\\nthe sitting-room floor with it.\\n\\nOne day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt’s yellow\\ncat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging\\nfor a taste. Tom said:\\n\\n“Don’t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.”\\n\\nBut Peter signified that he did want it.\\n\\n“You better make sure.”\\n\\nPeter was sure.\\n\\n“Now you’ve asked for it, and I’ll give it to you, because there ain’t\\nanything mean about me; but if you find you don’t like it, you mustn’t\\nblame anybody but your own self.”\\n\\nPeter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down\\nthe Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then\\ndelivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging\\nagainst furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next\\nhe rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,\\nwith his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his\\nunappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again\\nspreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time\\nto see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,\\nand sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots\\nwith him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over\\nher glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.\\n\\n“Tom, what on earth ails that cat?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, aunt,” gasped the boy.\\n\\n“Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?”\\n\\n“Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a\\ngood time.”\\n\\n“They do, do they?” There was something in the tone that made Tom\\napprehensive.\\n\\n“Yes’m. That is, I believe they do.”\\n\\n“You _do_?”\\n\\n“Yes’m.”\\n\\nThe old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized\\nby anxiety. Too late he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale\\ntea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it\\nup. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual\\nhandle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.\\n\\n“Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?”\\n\\n“I done it out of pity for him—because he hadn’t any aunt.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t any aunt!—you numskull. What has that got to do with it?”\\n\\n“Heaps. Because if he’d had one she’d a burnt him out herself! She’d a\\nroasted his bowels out of him ’thout any more feeling than if he was a\\nhuman!”\\n\\nAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in\\na new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.\\nShe began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she\\nput her hand on Tom’s head and said gently:\\n\\n“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.”\\n\\nTom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping\\nthrough his gravity.\\n\\n“I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It\\ndone _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since—”\\n\\n“Oh, go ’long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try\\nand see if you can’t be a good boy, for once, and you needn’t take any\\nmore medicine.”\\n\\nTom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing\\nhad been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,\\nhe hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his\\ncomrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to\\nbe looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road.\\nPresently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed\\na moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom\\naccosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about\\nBecky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and\\nwatched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the\\nowner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks\\nceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered\\nthe empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed\\nin at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he\\nwas out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,\\njumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,\\nstanding on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,\\nand keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher\\nwas noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never\\nlooked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?\\nHe carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping\\naround, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,\\nbroke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and\\nfell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and\\nshe turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some\\npeople think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”\\n\\nTom’s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and\\ncrestfallen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nTom’s mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a\\nforsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out\\nwhat they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried\\nto do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing\\nwould do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame\\n_him_ for the consequences—why shouldn’t they? What right had the\\nfriendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would\\nlead a life of crime. There was no choice.\\n\\nBy this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to\\n“take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he\\nshould never, never hear that old familiar sound any more—it was very\\nhard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold\\nworld, he must submit—but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and\\nfast.\\n\\nJust at this point he met his soul’s sworn comrade, Joe\\nHarper—hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his\\nheart. Plainly here were “two souls with but a single thought.” Tom,\\nwiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about\\na resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by\\nroaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping\\nthat Joe would not forget him.\\n\\nBut it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going\\nto make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother\\nhad whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and\\nknew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished\\nhim to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but\\nsuccumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her\\npoor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.\\n\\nAs the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand\\nby each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved\\nthem of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for\\nbeing a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,\\nsome time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he\\nconceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of\\ncrime, and so he consented to be a pirate.\\n\\nThree miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River\\nwas a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,\\nwith a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a\\nrendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further\\nshore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s\\nIsland was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a\\nmatter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,\\nand he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was\\nindifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the\\nriver-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was\\nmidnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.\\nEach would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal\\nin the most dark and mysterious way—as became outlaws. And before the\\nafternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of\\nspreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All\\nwho got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.”\\n\\nAbout midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,\\nand stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the\\nmeeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay\\nlike an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the\\nquiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under\\nthe bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the\\nsame way. Then a guarded voice said:\\n\\n“Who goes there?”\\n\\n“Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.”\\n\\n“Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.” Tom\\nhad furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.\\n\\n“’Tis well. Give the countersign.”\\n\\nTwo hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the\\nbrooding night:\\n\\n“_Blood_!”\\n\\nThen Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,\\ntearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was\\nan easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked\\nthe advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.\\n\\nThe Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn\\nhimself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a\\nskillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought\\na few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or\\n“chewed” but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it\\nwould never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;\\nmatches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering\\nupon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily\\nthither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing\\nadventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and suddenly\\nhalting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;\\nand giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe” stirred, to “let\\nhim have it to the hilt,” because “dead men tell no tales.” They knew\\nwell enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying\\nin stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their\\nconducting this thing in an unpiratical way.\\n\\nThey shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and\\nJoe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded\\narms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:\\n\\n“Luff, and bring her to the wind!”\\n\\n“Aye-aye, sir!”\\n\\n“Steady, steady-y-y-y!”\\n\\n“Steady it is, sir!”\\n\\n“Let her go off a point!”\\n\\n“Point it is, sir!”\\n\\nAs the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream\\nit was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for\\n“style,” and were not intended to mean anything in particular.\\n\\n“What sail’s she carrying?”\\n\\n“Courses, tops’ls, and flying-jib, sir.”\\n\\n“Send the r’yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of\\nye—foretopmaststuns’l! Lively, now!”\\n\\n“Aye-aye, sir!”\\n\\n“Shake out that maintogalans’l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!”\\n\\n“Aye-aye, sir!”\\n\\n“Hellum-a-lee—hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,\\nport! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!”\\n\\n“Steady it is, sir!”\\n\\nThe raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head\\nright, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was\\nnot more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during\\nthe next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before\\nthe distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,\\npeacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,\\nunconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black\\nAvenger stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the scene\\nof his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she” could see\\nhim now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless\\nheart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but\\na small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond\\neye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and\\nsatisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and\\nthey all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift\\nthem out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in\\ntime, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the\\nraft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,\\nand they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part\\nof the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they\\nspread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;\\nbut they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as\\nbecame outlaws.\\n\\nThey built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps\\nwithin the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in\\nthe frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn “pone” stock\\nthey had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,\\nfree way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,\\nfar from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to\\ncivilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy\\nglare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the\\nvarnished foliage and festooning vines.\\n\\nWhen the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance\\nof corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,\\nfilled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but\\nthey would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting\\ncampfire.\\n\\n“_Ain’t_ it gay?” said Joe.\\n\\n“It’s _nuts_!” said Tom. “What would the boys say if they could see us?”\\n\\n“Say? Well, they’d just die to be here—hey, Hucky!”\\n\\n“I reckon so,” said Huckleberry; “anyways, I’m suited. I don’t want\\nnothing better’n this. I don’t ever get enough to eat, gen’ally—and here\\nthey can’t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.”\\n\\n“It’s just the life for me,” said Tom. “You don’t have to get up,\\nmornings, and you don’t have to go to school, and wash, and all that\\nblame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t have to do _anything_, Joe,\\nwhen he’s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and\\nthen he don’t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, that’s so,” said Joe, “but I hadn’t thought much about it, you\\nknow. I’d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I’ve tried it.”\\n\\n“You see,” said Tom, “people don’t go much on hermits, nowadays, like\\nthey used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected. And\\na hermit’s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put\\nsackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and—”\\n\\n“What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?” inquired Huck.\\n\\n“I dono. But they’ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You’d have to do\\nthat if you was a hermit.”\\n\\n“Dern’d if I would,” said Huck.\\n\\n“Well, what would you do?”\\n\\n“I dono. But I wouldn’t do that.”\\n\\n“Why, Huck, you’d _have_ to. How’d you get around it?”\\n\\n“Why, I just wouldn’t stand it. I’d run away.”\\n\\n“Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You’d be\\na disgrace.”\\n\\nThe Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished\\ngouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with\\ntobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of\\nfragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The\\nother pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to\\nacquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:\\n\\n“What does pirates have to do?”\\n\\nTom said:\\n\\n“Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them, and get the\\nmoney and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts\\nand things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a\\nplank.”\\n\\n“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the\\nwomen.”\\n\\n“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women—they’re too noble. And\\nthe women’s always beautiful, too.”\\n\\n“And don’t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver\\nand di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm.\\n\\n“Who?” said Huck.\\n\\n“Why, the pirates.”\\n\\nHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.\\n\\n“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with a\\nregretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got none but these.”\\n\\nBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,\\nafter they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand\\nthat his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for\\nwealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\\n\\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the\\neyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the\\nRed-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.\\nThe Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had\\nmore difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,\\nand lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them\\nkneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at\\nall, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they\\nmight call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at\\nonce they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an\\nintruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began\\nto feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and\\nnext they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.\\nThey tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had\\npurloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not\\nto be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the\\nend, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking\\nsweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such\\nvaluables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that\\nin the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in\\nthe business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the\\ncrime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously\\ninconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nWhen Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and\\nrubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool\\ngray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the\\ndeep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not\\na sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood\\nupon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,\\nand a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck\\nstill slept.\\n\\nNow, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently\\nthe hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray\\nof the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life\\nmanifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going\\nto work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came\\ncrawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air\\nfrom time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he\\nwas measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own\\naccord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,\\nby turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to\\ngo elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its\\ncurved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and\\nbegan a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that\\nhe was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a\\ndoubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,\\nfrom nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled\\nmanfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,\\nand lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed\\nthe dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and\\nsaid, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your\\nchildren’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which\\ndid not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was\\ncredulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity\\nmore than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and\\nTom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body\\nand pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A\\ncatbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled\\nout her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then\\na shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig\\nalmost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the\\nstrangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow\\nof the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to\\ninspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never\\nseen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.\\nAll Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight\\npierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few\\nbutterflies came fluttering upon the scene.\\n\\nTom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with\\na shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and\\ntumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white\\nsandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the\\ndistance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a\\nslight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only\\ngratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge\\nbetween them and civilization.\\n\\nThey came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and\\nravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a\\nspring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak\\nor hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood\\ncharm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe\\nwas slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a\\nminute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in\\ntheir lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time\\nto get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,\\na couple of sun-perch and a small catfish—provisions enough for quite a\\nfamily. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for\\nno fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the\\nquicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better\\nhe is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,\\nopen-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.\\n\\nThey lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,\\nand then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They\\ntramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,\\namong solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the\\nground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came\\nupon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.\\n\\nThey found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be\\nastonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles\\nlong and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to\\nwas only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards\\nwide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle\\nof the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to\\nstop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw\\nthemselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,\\nand then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,\\nand the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.\\nThey fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This\\ntook dim shape, presently—it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the\\nRed-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they\\nwere all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak\\nhis thought.\\n\\nFor some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar\\nsound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a\\nclock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound\\nbecame more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,\\nglanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There\\nwas a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came\\nfloating down out of the distance.\\n\\n“What is it!” exclaimed Joe, under his breath.\\n\\n“I wonder,” said Tom in a whisper.\\n\\n“’Tain’t thunder,” said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, “becuz thunder—”\\n\\n“Hark!” said Tom. “Listen—don’t talk.”\\n\\nThey waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom\\ntroubled the solemn hush.\\n\\n“Let’s go and see.”\\n\\nThey sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They\\nparted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little\\nsteam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the\\ncurrent. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great\\nmany skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood\\nof the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in\\nthem were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the\\nferryboat’s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same\\ndull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.\\n\\n“I know now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody’s drownded!”\\n\\n“That’s it!” said Huck; “they done that last summer, when Bill Turner\\ngot drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes\\nhim come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put\\nquicksilver in ’em and set ’em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody\\nthat’s drownded, they’ll float right there and stop.”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” said Joe. “I wonder what makes the bread\\ndo that.”\\n\\n“Oh, it ain’t the bread, so much,” said Tom; “I reckon it’s mostly what\\nthey _say_ over it before they start it out.”\\n\\n“But they don’t say anything over it,” said Huck. “I’ve seen ’em and\\nthey don’t.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s funny,” said Tom. “But maybe they say it to themselves. Of\\n_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.”\\n\\nThe other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because\\nan ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not\\nbe expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such\\ngravity.\\n\\n“By jings, I wish I was over there, now,” said Joe.\\n\\n“I do too,” said Huck. “I’d give heaps to know who it is.”\\n\\nThe boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought\\nflashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:\\n\\n“Boys, I know who’s drownded—it’s us!”\\n\\nThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they\\nwere missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;\\ntears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor\\nlost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being\\nindulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,\\nand the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was\\nconcerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.\\n\\nAs twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business\\nand the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were\\njubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble\\nthey were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then\\nfell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;\\nand the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were\\ngratifying to look upon—from their point of view. But when the shadows\\nof night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing\\ninto the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The\\nexcitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts\\nof certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as\\nmuch as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a\\nsigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a\\nroundabout “feeler” as to how the others might look upon a return to\\ncivilization—not right now, but—\\n\\nTom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined\\nin with Tom, and the waverer quickly “explained,” and was glad to get\\nout of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness\\nclinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to\\nrest for the moment.\\n\\nAs the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.\\nJoe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,\\nwatching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,\\nand went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung\\nby the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders\\nof the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed\\nto suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something\\nupon each of these with his “red keel”; one he rolled up and put in his\\njacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe’s hat and removed it to a\\nlittle distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain\\nschoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value—among them a lump of\\nchalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind\\nof marbles known as a “sure ’nough crystal.” Then he tiptoed his way\\ncautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and\\nstraightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nA few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward\\nthe Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway\\nover; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out\\nconfidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering\\nupstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had\\nexpected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till\\nhe found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket\\npocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,\\nfollowing the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten\\no’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the\\nferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything\\nwas quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching\\nwith all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes\\nand climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He\\nlaid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\\n\\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast\\noff.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up,\\nagainst the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in\\nhis success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At\\nthe end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and\\nTom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards\\ndownstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.\\n\\nHe flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his\\naunt’s back fence. He climbed over, approached the “ell,” and looked\\nin at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There\\nsat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together,\\ntalking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the\\ndoor. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then\\nhe pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing\\ncautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might\\nsqueeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,\\nwarily.\\n\\n“What makes the candle blow so?” said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why,\\nthat door’s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange\\nthings now. Go ’long and shut it, Sid.”\\n\\nTom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and “breathed”\\n himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his\\naunt’s foot.\\n\\n“But as I was saying,” said Aunt Polly, “he warn’t _bad_, so to say—only\\nmisch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn’t\\nany more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was\\nthe best-hearted boy that ever was”—and she began to cry.\\n\\n“It was just so with my Joe—always full of his devilment, and up to\\nevery kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he\\ncould be—and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking\\nthat cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because\\nit was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,\\nnever, poor abused boy!” And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would\\nbreak.\\n\\n“I hope Tom’s better off where he is,” said Sid, “but if he’d been\\nbetter in some ways—”\\n\\n“_Sid!_” Tom felt the glare of the old lady’s eye, though he could not\\nsee it. “Not a word against my Tom, now that he’s gone! God’ll take care\\nof _him_—never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don’t\\nknow how to give him up! I don’t know how to give him up! He was such a\\ncomfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, ’most.”\\n\\n“The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away—Blessed be the name of\\nthe Lord! But it’s so hard—Oh, it’s so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe\\nbusted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.\\nLittle did I know then, how soon—Oh, if it was to do over again I’d hug\\nhim and bless him for it.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just\\nexactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took\\nand filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would\\ntear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s head with my\\nthimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he’s out of all his troubles now.\\nAnd the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach—”\\n\\nBut this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely\\ndown. Tom was snuffling, now, himself—and more in pity of himself than\\nanybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word\\nfor him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself\\nthan ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt’s grief\\nto long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy—and\\nthe theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his\\nnature, too, but he resisted and lay still.\\n\\nHe went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was\\nconjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;\\nthen the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing\\nlads had promised that the village should “hear something” soon; the\\nwise-heads had “put this and that together” and decided that the lads\\nhad gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,\\npresently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the\\nMissouri shore some five or six miles below the village—and then hope\\nperished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home\\nby nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the\\nbodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must\\nhave occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would\\notherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies\\ncontinued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the\\nfunerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.\\n\\nMrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a\\nmutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s\\narms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was\\ntender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid\\nsnuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.\\n\\nAunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,\\nand with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,\\nthat he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.\\n\\nHe had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making\\nbroken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and\\nturning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her\\nsleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the\\ncandle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full\\nof pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the\\ncandle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.\\nHis face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark\\nhastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and\\nstraightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.\\n\\nHe threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large\\nthere, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was\\ntenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and\\nslept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped\\ninto it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a\\nmile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself\\nstoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for\\nthis was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture\\nthe skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore\\nlegitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be\\nmade for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and\\nentered the woods.\\n\\nHe sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep\\nawake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far\\nspent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the\\nisland bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the\\ngreat river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A\\nlittle later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and\\nheard Joe say:\\n\\n“No, Tom’s true-blue, Huck, and he’ll come back. He won’t desert. He\\nknows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom’s too proud for that\\nsort of thing. He’s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?”\\n\\n“Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain’t they?”\\n\\n“Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain’t\\nback here to breakfast.”\\n\\n“Which he is!” exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping\\ngrandly into camp.\\n\\nA sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the\\nboys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.\\nThey were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.\\nThen Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the\\nother pirates got ready to fish and explore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nAfter dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.\\nThey went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft\\nplace they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes\\nthey would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly\\nround white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a\\nfamous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\\n\\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and\\nchased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until\\nthey were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal\\nwater of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their\\nlegs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.\\nAnd now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each\\nother’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with\\naverted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and\\nstruggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all\\nwent under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,\\nsputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\\n\\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,\\nhot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by\\nbreak for the water again and go through the original performance once\\nmore. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented\\nflesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and\\nhad a circus—with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest\\npost to his neighbor.\\n\\nNext they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and\\n“keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another\\nswim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off\\nhis trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his\\nankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the\\nprotection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he\\nhad found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to\\nrest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the “dumps,” and\\nfell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay\\ndrowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing “BECKY” in the sand with\\nhis big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his\\nweakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He\\nerased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving\\nthe other boys together and joining them.\\n\\nBut Joe’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so\\nhomesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay\\nvery near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,\\nbut tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready\\nto tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he\\nwould have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:\\n\\n“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore\\nit again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light\\non a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”\\n\\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.\\nTom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was\\ndiscouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking\\nvery gloomy. Finally he said:\\n\\n“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”\\n\\n“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the\\nfishing that’s here.”\\n\\n“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”\\n\\n“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”\\n\\n“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there\\nain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”\\n\\n“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”\\n\\n“Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I\\nain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.\\n\\n“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor\\nthing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,\\ndon’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”\\n\\nHuck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.\\n\\n“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising.\\n“There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\\n\\n“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long home and get\\nlaughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll\\nstay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get\\nalong without him, per’aps.”\\n\\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly\\non with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying\\nJoe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.\\nPresently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the\\nIllinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck\\ncould not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\\n\\n“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now\\nit’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”\\n\\n“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”\\n\\n“Tom, I better go.”\\n\\n“Well, go ’long—who’s hendering you.”\\n\\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\\n\\n“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you\\nwhen we get to shore.”\\n\\n“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”\\n\\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a\\nstrong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along\\ntoo. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It\\nsuddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made\\none final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,\\nyelling:\\n\\n“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”\\n\\nThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they\\nwere, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till\\nat last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a\\nwarwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had\\ntold them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible\\nexcuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret\\nwould keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had\\nmeant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.\\n\\nThe lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,\\nchattering all the time about Tom’s stupendous plan and admiring the\\ngenius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to\\nlearn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to\\ntry, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never\\nsmoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the\\ntongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\\n\\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,\\ncharily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,\\nand they gagged a little, but Tom said:\\n\\n“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long\\nago.”\\n\\n“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”\\n\\n“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish\\nI could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.\\n\\n“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just\\nthat way—haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”\\n\\n“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.\\n\\n“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the\\nslaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and\\nJohnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember,\\nHuck, ’bout me saying that?”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white\\nalley. No, ’twas the day before.”\\n\\n“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”\\n\\n“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel\\nsick.”\\n\\n“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff\\nThatcher couldn’t.”\\n\\n“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him\\ntry it once. _He’d_ see!”\\n\\n“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle\\nit once.”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more\\ndo this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.”\\n\\n“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”\\n\\n“So do I.”\\n\\n“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re\\naround, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’\\nAnd you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll\\nsay, ‘Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t\\nvery good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s _strong_\\nenough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as\\nca’m, and then just see ’em look!”\\n\\n“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!”\\n\\n“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating,\\nwon’t they wish they’d been along?”\\n\\n“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just _bet_ they will!”\\n\\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and\\ngrow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously\\nincreased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting\\nfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\\nfast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their\\nthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\\nfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,\\nnow. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both\\nfountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and\\nmain. Joe said feebly:\\n\\n“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”\\n\\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\\n\\n“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.\\nNo, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”\\n\\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,\\nand went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both\\nvery pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had\\nhad any trouble they had got rid of it.\\n\\nThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\\nand when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\\ntheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate\\nat dinner had disagreed with them.\\n\\nAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding\\noppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys\\nhuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of\\nthe fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was\\nstifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.\\nBeyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the\\nblackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that\\nvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by\\nanother came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came\\nsighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting\\nbreath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit\\nof the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned\\nnight into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and\\ndistinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,\\nstartled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling\\ndown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A\\nsweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the\\nflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the\\nforest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops\\nright over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick\\ngloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.\\n\\n“Quick! boys, go for the tent!” exclaimed Tom.\\n\\nThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no\\ntwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through\\nthe trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after\\nanother came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching\\nrain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the\\nground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the\\nbooming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one\\nthey straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,\\nand streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something\\nto be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so\\nfuriously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest\\nrose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its\\nfastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each\\nothers’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter\\nof a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its\\nhighest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed\\nin the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless\\ndistinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the\\ndriving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on\\nthe other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting\\nveil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight\\nand fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging\\nthunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,\\nand unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort\\nthat seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to\\nthe treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one\\nand the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be\\nout in.\\n\\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and\\nweaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The\\nboys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still\\nsomething to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter\\nof their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were\\nnot under it when the catastrophe happened.\\n\\nEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but\\nheedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against\\nrain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and\\nchilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently\\ndiscovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had\\nbeen built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from\\nthe ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they\\npatiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under\\nsides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they\\npiled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were\\ngladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,\\nand after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their\\nmidnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep\\non, anywhere around.\\n\\nAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over\\nthem, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got\\nscorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After\\nthe meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once\\nmore. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as\\nhe could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or\\nanything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of\\ncheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was\\nto knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.\\nThey were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were\\nstripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many\\nzebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through\\nthe woods to attack an English settlement.\\n\\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each\\nother from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each\\nother by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely\\nsatisfactory one.\\n\\nThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now\\na difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of\\nhospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple\\nimpossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other\\nprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished\\nthey had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such\\nshow of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and\\ntook their whiff as it passed, in due form.\\n\\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had\\ngained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without\\nhaving to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to\\nbe seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high\\npromise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,\\nwith right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were\\nprouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been\\nin the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to\\nsmoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at\\npresent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nBut there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday\\nafternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly’s family, were being put into\\nmourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed\\nthe village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.\\nThe villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked\\nlittle; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to\\nthe children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them\\nup.\\n\\nIn the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted\\nschoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing\\nthere to comfort her. She soliloquized:\\n\\n“Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven’t got\\nanything now to remember him by.” And she choked back a little sob.\\n\\nPresently she stopped, and said to herself:\\n\\n“It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn’t say\\nthat—I wouldn’t say it for the whole world. But he’s gone now; I’ll\\nnever, never, never see him any more.”\\n\\nThis thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling\\ndown her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls—playmates of Tom’s\\nand Joe’s—came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking\\nin reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw\\nhim, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful\\nprophecy, as they could easily see now!)—and each speaker pointed out\\nthe exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added\\nsomething like “and I was a-standing just so—just as I am now, and as if\\nyou was him—I was as close as that—and he smiled, just this way—and then\\nsomething seemed to go all over me, like—awful, you know—and I never\\nthought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!”\\n\\nThen there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and\\nmany claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or\\nless tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided\\nwho _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,\\nthe lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,\\nand were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had\\nno other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the\\nremembrance:\\n\\n“Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.”\\n\\nBut that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,\\nand so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,\\nstill recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.\\n\\nWhen the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell\\nbegan to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still\\nSabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush\\nthat lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment\\nin the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there\\nwas no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses\\nas the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None\\ncould remember when the little church had been so full before. There\\nwas finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly\\nentered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in\\ndeep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose\\nreverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.\\nThere was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled\\nsobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving\\nhymn was sung, and the text followed: “I am the Resurrection and the\\nLife.”\\n\\nAs the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the\\ngraces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that\\nevery soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang\\nin remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always\\nbefore, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor\\nboys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the\\ndeparted, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the\\npeople could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes\\nwere, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had\\nseemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation\\nbecame more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last\\nthe whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus\\nof anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and\\ncrying in the pulpit.\\n\\nThere was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later\\nthe church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above\\nhis handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair\\nof eyes followed the minister’s, and then almost with one impulse the\\ncongregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up\\nthe aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,\\nsneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery\\nlistening to their own funeral sermon!\\n\\nAunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored\\nones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while\\npoor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what\\nto do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and\\nstarted to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:\\n\\n“Aunt Polly, it ain’t fair. Somebody’s got to be glad to see Huck.”\\n\\n“And so they shall. I’m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!” And\\nthe loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing\\ncapable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.\\n\\nSuddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: “Praise God from\\nwhom all blessings flow—_sing_!—and put your hearts in it!”\\n\\nAnd they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and\\nwhile it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the\\nenvying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the\\nproudest moment of his life.\\n\\nAs the “sold” congregation trooped out they said they would almost be\\nwilling to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that\\nonce more.\\n\\nTom got more cuffs and kisses that day—according to Aunt Polly’s varying\\nmoods—than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which\\nexpressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nThat was Tom’s great secret—the scheme to return home with his brother\\npirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the\\nMissouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles\\nbelow the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town\\ntill nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys\\nand finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of\\ninvalided benches.\\n\\nAt breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to\\nTom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of\\ntalk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:\\n\\n“Well, I don’t say it wasn’t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody\\nsuffering ’most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you\\ncould be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over\\non a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a\\nhint some way that you warn’t dead, but only run off.”\\n\\n“Yes, you could have done that, Tom,” said Mary; “and I believe you\\nwould if you had thought of it.”\\n\\n“Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. “Say,\\nnow, would you, if you’d thought of it?”\\n\\n“I—well, I don’t know. ’Twould ’a’ spoiled everything.”\\n\\n“Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,” said Aunt Polly, with a grieved\\ntone that discomforted the boy. “It would have been something if you’d\\ncared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn’t _do_ it.”\\n\\n“Now, auntie, that ain’t any harm,” pleaded Mary; “it’s only Tom’s giddy\\nway—he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.”\\n\\n“More’s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and\\n_done_ it, too. Tom, you’ll look back, some day, when it’s too late,\\nand wish you’d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so\\nlittle.”\\n\\n“Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,” said Tom.\\n\\n“I’d know it better if you acted more like it.”\\n\\n“I wish now I’d thought,” said Tom, with a repentant tone; “but I dreamt\\nabout you, anyway. That’s something, ain’t it?”\\n\\n“It ain’t much—a cat does that much—but it’s better than nothing. What\\ndid you dream?”\\n\\n“Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the\\nbed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.”\\n\\n“Well, so we did. So we always do. I’m glad your dreams could take even\\nthat much trouble about us.”\\n\\n“And I dreamt that Joe Harper’s mother was here.”\\n\\n“Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?”\\n\\n“Oh, lots. But it’s so dim, now.”\\n\\n“Well, try to recollect—can’t you?”\\n\\n“Somehow it seems to me that the wind—the wind blowed the—the—”\\n\\n“Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!”\\n\\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then\\nsaid:\\n\\n“I’ve got it now! I’ve got it now! It blowed the candle!”\\n\\n“Mercy on us! Go on, Tom—go on!”\\n\\n“And it seems to me that you said, ‘Why, I believe that that door—’”\\n\\n“Go _on_, Tom!”\\n\\n“Just let me study a moment—just a moment. Oh, yes—you said you believed\\nthe door was open.”\\n\\n“As I’m sitting here, I did! Didn’t I, Mary! Go on!”\\n\\n“And then—and then—well I won’t be certain, but it seems like as if you\\nmade Sid go and—and—”\\n\\n“Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?”\\n\\n“You made him—you—Oh, you made him shut it.”\\n\\n“Well, for the land’s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my\\ndays! Don’t tell _me_ there ain’t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny\\nHarper shall know of this before I’m an hour older. I’d like to see her\\nget around _this_ with her rubbage ’bout superstition. Go on, Tom!”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn’t\\n_bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible\\nthan—than—I think it was a colt, or something.”\\n\\n“And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!”\\n\\n“And then you began to cry.”\\n\\n“So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then—”\\n\\n“Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and\\nshe wished she hadn’t whipped him for taking cream when she’d throwed it\\nout her own self—”\\n\\n“Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying—that’s what you\\nwas doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!”\\n\\n“Then Sid he said—he said—”\\n\\n“I don’t think I said anything,” said Sid.\\n\\n“Yes you did, Sid,” said Mary.\\n\\n“Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?”\\n\\n“He said—I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone\\nto, but if I’d been better sometimes—”\\n\\n“_There_, d’you hear that! It was his very words!”\\n\\n“And you shut him up sharp.”\\n\\n“I lay I did! There must ’a’ been an angel there. There _was_ an angel\\nthere, somewheres!”\\n\\n“And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you\\ntold about Peter and the Pain-killer—”\\n\\n“Just as true as I live!”\\n\\n“And then there was a whole lot of talk ’bout dragging the river for us,\\nand ’bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper\\nhugged and cried, and she went.”\\n\\n“It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I’m a-sitting in\\nthese very tracks. Tom, you couldn’t told it more like if you’d ’a’ seen\\nit! And then what? Go on, Tom!”\\n\\n“Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every\\nword you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and\\nwrote on a piece of sycamore bark, ‘We ain’t dead—we are only off being\\npirates,’ and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked\\nso good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and\\nkissed you on the lips.”\\n\\n“Did you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that!” And\\nshe seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the\\nguiltiest of villains.\\n\\n“It was very kind, even though it was only a—dream,” Sid soliloquized\\njust audibly.\\n\\n“Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he’d do if he was\\nawake. Here’s a big Milum apple I’ve been saving for you, Tom, if you\\nwas ever found again—now go ’long to school. I’m thankful to the good\\nGod and Father of us all I’ve got you back, that’s long-suffering and\\nmerciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness\\nknows I’m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings\\nand had His hand to help them over the rough places, there’s few enough\\nwould smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.\\nGo ’long Sid, Mary, Tom—take yourselves off—you’ve hendered me long\\nenough.”\\n\\nThe children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper\\nand vanquish her realism with Tom’s marvellous dream. Sid had better\\njudgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the\\nhouse. It was this: “Pretty thin—as long a dream as that, without any\\nmistakes in it!”\\n\\nWhat a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,\\nbut moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the\\npublic eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see\\nthe looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and\\ndrink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud\\nto be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer\\nat the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into\\ntown. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at\\nall; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have\\ngiven anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his\\nglittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a\\ncircus.\\n\\nAt school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered\\nsuch eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were\\nnot long in becoming insufferably “stuck-up.” They began to tell their\\nadventures to hungry listeners—but they only began; it was not a\\nthing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish\\nmaterial. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely\\npuffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.\\n\\nTom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory\\nwas sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,\\nmaybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her—she should see\\nthat he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she\\narrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group\\nof boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was\\ntripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,\\npretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter\\nwhen she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her\\ncaptures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye\\nin his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity\\nthat was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up”\\n the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he\\nknew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved\\nirresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and\\nwistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more\\nparticularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang\\nand grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her\\nfeet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to\\na girl almost at Tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity:\\n\\n“Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn’t you come to Sunday-school?”\\n\\n“I did come—didn’t you see me?”\\n\\n“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”\\n\\n“I was in Miss Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw _you_.”\\n\\n“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to tell you about\\nthe picnic.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to give it?”\\n\\n“My ma’s going to let me have one.”\\n\\n“Oh, goody; I hope she’ll let _me_ come.”\\n\\n“Well, she will. The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody come that I\\nwant, and I want you.”\\n\\n“That’s ever so nice. When is it going to be?”\\n\\n“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”\\n\\n“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?”\\n\\n“Yes, every one that’s friends to me—or wants to be”; and she glanced\\never so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence\\nabout the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the\\ngreat sycamore tree “all to flinders” while he was “standing within\\nthree feet of it.”\\n\\n“Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And me?” said Sally Rogers.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged\\nfor invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still\\ntalking, and took Amy with him. Becky’s lips trembled and the tears\\ncame to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on\\nchattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of\\neverything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and\\nhad what her sex call “a good cry.” Then she sat moody, with wounded\\npride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast\\nin her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what\\n_she’d_ do.\\n\\nAt recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant\\nself-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate\\nher with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden\\nfalling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind\\nthe schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple—and so\\nabsorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,\\nthat they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.\\nJealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for\\nthrowing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He\\ncalled himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He\\nwanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,\\nfor her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He\\ndid not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly\\nhe could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced\\nas otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and\\nagain, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could\\nnot help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that\\nBecky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the\\nliving. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her\\nfight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\\n\\nAmy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had\\nto attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in\\nvain—the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, ain’t I ever going\\nto get rid of her?” At last he must be attending to those things—and she\\nsaid artlessly that she would be “around” when school let out. And he\\nhastened away, hating her for it.\\n\\n“Any other boy!” Tom thought, grating his teeth. “Any boy in the whole\\ntown but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is\\naristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this\\ntown, mister, and I’ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you\\nout! I’ll just take and—”\\n\\nAnd he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy—pummelling\\nthe air, and kicking and gouging. “Oh, you do, do you? You holler\\n’nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!” And so the imaginary\\nflogging was finished to his satisfaction.\\n\\nTom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy’s\\ngrateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other\\ndistress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the\\nminutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to\\ncloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,\\nand then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at\\na footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew\\nentirely miserable and wished she hadn’t carried it so far. When\\npoor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept\\nexclaiming: “Oh, here’s a jolly one! look at this!” she lost patience at\\nlast, and said, “Oh, don’t bother me! I don’t care for them!” and burst\\ninto tears, and got up and walked away.\\n\\nAlfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Go away and leave me alone, can’t you! I hate you!”\\n\\nSo the boy halted, wondering what he could have done—for she had said\\nshe would look at pictures all through the nooning—and she walked on,\\ncrying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was\\nhumiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth—the girl\\nhad simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.\\nHe was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.\\nHe wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much\\nrisk to himself. Tom’s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his\\nopportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and\\npoured ink upon the page.\\n\\nBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,\\nand moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,\\nintending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their\\ntroubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she\\nhad changed her mind. The thought of Tom’s treatment of her when she was\\ntalking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.\\nShe resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book’s\\naccount, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nTom arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said\\nto him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising\\nmarket:\\n\\n“Tom, I’ve a notion to skin you alive!”\\n\\n“Auntie, what have I done?”\\n\\n“Well, you’ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old\\nsofty, expecting I’m going to make her believe all that rubbage about\\nthat dream, when lo and behold you she’d found out from Joe that you was\\nover here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don’t know\\nwhat is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so\\nbad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool\\nof myself and never say a word.”\\n\\nThis was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had\\nseemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked\\nmean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to\\nsay for a moment. Then he said:\\n\\n“Auntie, I wish I hadn’t done it—but I didn’t think.”\\n\\n“Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your\\nown selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from\\nJackson’s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could\\nthink to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn’t ever think\\nto pity us and save us from sorrow.”\\n\\n“Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn’t mean to be mean. I didn’t,\\nhonest. And besides, I didn’t come over here to laugh at you that\\nnight.”\\n\\n“What did you come for, then?”\\n\\n“It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn’t got\\ndrownded.”\\n\\n“Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could\\nbelieve you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never\\ndid—and I know it, Tom.”\\n\\n“Indeed and ’deed I did, auntie—I wish I may never stir if I didn’t.”\\n\\n“Oh, Tom, don’t lie—don’t do it. It only makes things a hundred times\\nworse.”\\n\\n“It ain’t a lie, auntie; it’s the truth. I wanted to keep you from\\ngrieving—that was all that made me come.”\\n\\n“I’d give the whole world to believe that—it would cover up a power\\nof sins, Tom. I’d ’most be glad you’d run off and acted so bad. But it\\nain’t reasonable; because, why didn’t you tell me, child?”\\n\\n“Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all\\nfull of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn’t\\nsomehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and\\nkept mum.”\\n\\n“What bark?”\\n\\n“The bark I had wrote on to tell you we’d gone pirating. I wish, now,\\nyou’d waked up when I kissed you—I do, honest.”\\n\\nThe hard lines in his aunt’s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned\\nin her eyes.\\n\\n“_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?”\\n\\n“Why, yes, I did.”\\n\\n“Are you sure you did, Tom?”\\n\\n“Why, yes, I did, auntie—certain sure.”\\n\\n“What did you kiss me for, Tom?”\\n\\n“Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.”\\n\\nThe words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in\\nher voice when she said:\\n\\n“Kiss me again, Tom!—and be off with you to school, now, and don’t\\nbother me any more.”\\n\\nThe moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a\\njacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her\\nhand, and said to herself:\\n\\n“No, I don’t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he’s lied about it—but it’s a\\nblessed, blessed lie, there’s such a comfort come from it. I hope\\nthe Lord—I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such\\ngood-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don’t want to find out it’s a\\nlie. I won’t look.”\\n\\nShe put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out\\nher hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more\\nshe ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:\\n“It’s a good lie—it’s a good lie—I won’t let it grieve me.” So she\\nsought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom’s piece of\\nbark through flowing tears and saying: “I could forgive the boy, now, if\\nhe’d committed a million sins!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\n\\nThere was something about Aunt Polly’s manner, when she kissed Tom, that\\nswept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He\\nstarted to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the\\nhead of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a\\nmoment’s hesitation he ran to her and said:\\n\\n“I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I’m so sorry. I won’t ever, ever\\ndo that way again, as long as ever I live—please make up, won’t you?”\\n\\nThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:\\n\\n“I’ll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I’ll\\nnever speak to you again.”\\n\\nShe tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not\\neven presence of mind enough to say “Who cares, Miss Smarty?” until the\\nright time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a\\nfine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were\\na boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently\\nencountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled\\none in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in\\nher hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to “take in,”\\n she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.\\nIf she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom’s\\noffensive fling had driven it entirely away.\\n\\nPoor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.\\nThe master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied\\nambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but\\npoverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village\\nschoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and\\nabsorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept\\nthat book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was\\nperishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy\\nand girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories\\nwere alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.\\nNow, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she\\nnoticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She\\nglanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the\\nbook in her hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody’s _Anatomy_—carried\\nno information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at\\nonce upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure,\\nstark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer\\nstepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky\\nsnatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the\\npictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,\\nturned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.\\n\\n“Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person\\nand look at what they’re looking at.”\\n\\n“How could I know you was looking at anything?”\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you’re\\ngoing to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I’ll be\\nwhipped, and I never was whipped in school.”\\n\\nThen she stamped her little foot and said:\\n\\n“_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that’s going to happen.\\nYou just wait and you’ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!”—and she flung\\nout of the house with a new explosion of crying.\\n\\nTom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said\\nto himself:\\n\\n“What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in\\nschool! Shucks! What’s a licking! That’s just like a girl—they’re so\\nthin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain’t going to tell\\nold Dobbins on this little fool, because there’s other ways of getting\\neven on her, that ain’t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask\\nwho it was tore his book. Nobody’ll answer. Then he’ll do just the way\\nhe always does—ask first one and then t’other, and when he comes to the\\nright girl he’ll know it, without any telling. Girls’ faces always tell\\non them. They ain’t got any backbone. She’ll get licked. Well, it’s a\\nkind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain’t any way\\nout of it.” Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: “All\\nright, though; she’d like to see me in just such a fix—let her sweat it\\nout!”\\n\\nTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the\\nmaster arrived and school “took in.” Tom did not feel a strong interest\\nin his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls’ side of the\\nroom Becky’s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want\\nto pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get\\nup no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the\\nspelling-book discovery was made, and Tom’s mind was entirely full\\nof his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her\\nlethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She\\ndid not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he\\nspilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only\\nseemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad\\nof that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she\\nwas not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse\\nto get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced\\nherself to keep still—because, said she to herself, “he’ll tell about me\\ntearing the picture sure. I wouldn’t say a word, not to save his life!”\\n\\nTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all\\nbroken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly\\nupset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout—he\\nhad denied it for form’s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck\\nto the denial from principle.\\n\\nA whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air\\nwas drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened\\nhimself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,\\nbut seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the\\npupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched\\nhis movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently\\nfor a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!\\nTom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit\\nlook as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot\\nhis quarrel with her. Quick—something must be done! done in a flash,\\ntoo! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.\\nGood!—he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring\\nthrough the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little\\ninstant, and the chance was lost—the master opened the volume. If Tom\\nonly had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help\\nfor Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.\\nEvery eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even\\nthe innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten—the\\nmaster was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: “Who tore this book?”\\n\\nThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness\\ncontinued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\\n\\n“Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?”\\n\\nA denial. Another pause.\\n\\n“Joseph Harper, did you?”\\n\\nAnother denial. Tom’s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the\\nslow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of\\nboys—considered a while, then turned to the girls:\\n\\n“Amy Lawrence?”\\n\\nA shake of the head.\\n\\n“Gracie Miller?”\\n\\nThe same sign.\\n\\n“Susan Harper, did you do this?”\\n\\nAnother negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling\\nfrom head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the\\nsituation.\\n\\n“Rebecca Thatcher” [Tom glanced at her face—it was white with\\nterror]—“did you tear—no, look me in the face” [her hands rose in\\nappeal]—“did you tear this book?”\\n\\nA thought shot like lightning through Tom’s brain. He sprang to his feet\\nand shouted—“I done it!”\\n\\nThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a\\nmoment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward\\nto go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that\\nshone upon him out of poor Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred\\nfloggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without\\nan outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever\\nadministered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a\\ncommand to remain two hours after school should be dismissed—for he\\nknew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not\\ncount the tedious time as loss, either.\\n\\nTom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for\\nwith shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own\\ntreachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to\\npleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky’s latest words\\nlingering dreamily in his ear—\\n\\n“Tom, how _could_ you be so noble!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\n\\nVacation was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer\\nand more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good\\nshowing on “Examination” day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle\\nnow—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young\\nladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings\\nwere very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a\\nperfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there\\nwas no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,\\nall the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a\\nvindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence\\nwas, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and\\ntheir nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do\\nthe master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution\\nthat followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that\\nthe boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they\\nconspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.\\nThey swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his\\nhelp. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded\\nin his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.\\nThe master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and\\nthere would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always\\nprepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and\\nthe signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper\\ncondition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he\\nnapped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time\\nand hurried away to school.\\n\\nIn the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in\\nthe evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with\\nwreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in\\nhis great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.\\nHe was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and\\nsix rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town\\nand by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of\\ncitizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the\\nscholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of\\nsmall boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;\\nrows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in\\nlawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their\\ngrandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and\\nthe flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with\\nnon-participating scholars.\\n\\nThe exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,\\n“You’d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,”\\n etc.—accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic\\ngestures which a machine might have used—supposing the machine to be a\\ntrifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,\\nand got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and\\nretired.\\n\\nA little shamefaced girl lisped, “Mary had a little lamb,” etc.,\\nperformed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and\\nsat down flushed and happy.\\n\\nTom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into\\nthe unquenchable and indestructible “Give me liberty or give me death”\\n speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the\\nmiddle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under\\nhim and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the\\nhouse but he had the house’s silence, too, which was even worse than\\nits sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom\\nstruggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak\\nattempt at applause, but it died early.\\n\\n“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck” followed; also “The Assyrian Came\\nDown,” and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,\\nand a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The\\nprime feature of the evening was in order, now—original “compositions”\\nby the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the\\nplatform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty\\nribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression”\\nand punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon\\nsimilar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and\\ndoubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the\\nCrusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in\\nHistory”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political\\nGovernment Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart\\nLongings,” etc., etc.\\n\\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted\\nmelancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”;\\nanother was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words\\nand phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that\\nconspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable\\nsermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of\\nthem. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was\\nmade to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious\\nmind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of\\nthese sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the\\nfashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will\\nbe sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all\\nour land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their\\ncompositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the\\nmost frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the\\nlongest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely\\ntruth is unpalatable.\\n\\nLet us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read\\nwas one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an\\nextract from it:\\n\\n“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the\\nyouthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!\\nImagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the\\nvoluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the\\nobserved of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,\\nis whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,\\nher step is lightest in the gay assembly.\\n\\n“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour\\narrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has\\nhad such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her\\nenchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But\\nafter a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is\\nvanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly\\nupon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health\\nand imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly\\npleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”\\n\\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to\\ntime during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How\\nsweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed\\nwith a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\\n\\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting”\\n paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two\\nstanzas of it will do:\\n\\n“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\\n\\n“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!\\n    But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\\n    And burning recollections throng my brow!\\nFor I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\\n    Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream;\\nHave listened to Tallassee’s warring floods,\\n    And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.\\n\\n“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart,\\n    Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\\n’Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\\n    ’Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\\nWelcome and home were mine within this State,\\n    Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me\\nAnd cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tête,\\n    When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!”\\n\\nThere were very few there who knew what “_tête_” meant, but the poem\\nwas very satisfactory, nevertheless.\\n\\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,\\nwho paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began\\nto read in a measured, solemn tone:\\n\\n                              A VISION\\n\\nDark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single\\nstar quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly\\nvibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry\\nmood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power\\nexerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous\\nwinds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered\\nabout as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.\\n\\nAt such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit\\nsighed; but instead thereof,\\n\\n     ‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide—\\n     My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side.\\n\\nShe moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks\\nof fancy’s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned\\nsave by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it\\nfailed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by\\nher genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided\\naway unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features,\\nlike icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the\\ncontending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings\\npresented.\\n\\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a\\nsermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took\\nthe first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest\\neffort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize\\nto the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by\\nfar the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel\\nWebster himself might well be proud of it.\\n\\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which\\nthe word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to\\nas “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.\\n\\nNow the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair\\naside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of\\nAmerica on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he\\nmade a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter\\nrippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to\\nright it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted\\nthem more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his\\nentire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down\\nby the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined\\nhe was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly\\nincreased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with\\na scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,\\nsuspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about\\nher head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she\\ncurved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed\\nat the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was\\nwithin six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, a little\\nlower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,\\nand was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still\\nin her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master’s\\nbald pate—for the signpainter’s boy had _gilded_ it!\\n\\nThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.\\n\\n[*] NOTE:—The pretended “compositions” quoted in this chapter are taken\\nwithout alteration from a volume entitled “Prose and Poetry, by a\\nWestern Lady”—but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl\\npattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\n\\nTom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the\\nshowy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking,\\nchewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out\\na new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way\\nin the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon\\nfound himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire\\ngrew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display\\nhimself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth\\nof July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had\\nworn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old\\nJudge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed\\nand would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.\\nDuring three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition\\nand hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that\\nhe would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the\\nlooking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.\\nAt last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was\\ndisgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation\\nat once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom\\nresolved that he would never trust a man like that again.\\n\\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated\\nto kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,\\nhowever—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but\\nfound to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he\\ncould, took the desire away, and the charm of it.\\n\\nTom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning\\nto hang a little heavily on his hands.\\n\\nHe attempted a diary—but nothing happened during three days, and so he\\nabandoned it.\\n\\nThe first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a\\nsensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy\\nfor two days.\\n\\nEven the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained\\nhard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man\\nin the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States\\nSenator, proved an overwhelming disappointment—for he was not\\ntwenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.\\n\\nA circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents\\nmade of rag carpeting—admission, three pins for boys, two for girls—and\\nthen circusing was abandoned.\\n\\nA phrenologist and a mesmerizer came—and went again and left the village\\nduller and drearier than ever.\\n\\nThere were some boys-and-girls’ parties, but they were so few and so\\ndelightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.\\n\\nBecky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her\\nparents during vacation—so there was no bright side to life anywhere.\\n\\nThe dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very\\ncancer for permanency and pain.\\n\\nThen came the measles.\\n\\nDuring two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its\\nhappenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got\\nupon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had\\ncome over everything and every creature. There had been a “revival,” and\\neverybody had “got religion,” not only the adults, but even the boys and\\ngirls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed\\nsinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe\\nHarper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing\\nspectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a\\nbasket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to\\nthe precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy\\nhe encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in\\ndesperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn\\nand was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he\\ncrept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,\\nforever and forever.\\n\\nAnd that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful\\nclaps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head\\nwith the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for\\nhe had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.\\nHe believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the\\nextremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have\\nseemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a\\nbattery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the\\ngetting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from\\nunder an insect like himself.\\n\\nBy and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its\\nobject. The boy’s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His\\nsecond was to wait—for there might not be any more storms.\\n\\nThe next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he\\nspent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad\\nat last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how\\nlonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted\\nlistlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a\\njuvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her\\nvictim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a\\nstolen melon. Poor lads! they—like Tom—had suffered a relapse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\n\\nAt last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred—and vigorously: the murder\\ntrial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village\\ntalk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to\\nthe murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience\\nand fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in\\nhis hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of\\nknowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable\\nin the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.\\nHe took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some\\nrelief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of\\ndistress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself\\nthat Huck had remained discreet.\\n\\n“Huck, have you ever told anybody about—that?”\\n\\n“’Bout what?”\\n\\n“You know what.”\\n\\n“Oh—’course I haven’t.”\\n\\n“Never a word?”\\n\\n“Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?”\\n\\n“Well, I was afeard.”\\n\\n“Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn’t be alive two days if that got found out.\\n_You_ know that.”\\n\\nTom felt more comfortable. After a pause:\\n\\n“Huck, they couldn’t anybody get you to tell, could they?”\\n\\n“Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they\\ncould get me to tell. They ain’t no different way.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s all right, then. I reckon we’re safe as long as we keep\\nmum. But let’s swear again, anyway. It’s more surer.”\\n\\n“I’m agreed.”\\n\\nSo they swore again with dread solemnities.\\n\\n“What is the talk around, Huck? I’ve heard a power of it.”\\n\\n“Talk? Well, it’s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the\\ntime. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so’s I want to hide som’ers.”\\n\\n“That’s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he’s a goner.\\nDon’t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?”\\n\\n“Most always—most always. He ain’t no account; but then he hain’t ever\\ndone anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to\\nget drunk on—and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do\\nthat—leastways most of us—preachers and such like. But he’s kind of\\ngood—he give me half a fish, once, when there warn’t enough for two; and\\nlots of times he’s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”\\n\\n“Well, he’s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.\\nI wish we could get him out of there.”\\n\\n“My! we couldn’t get him out, Tom. And besides, ’twouldn’t do any good;\\nthey’d ketch him again.”\\n\\n“Yes—so they would. But I hate to hear ’em abuse him so like the dickens\\nwhen he never done—that.”\\n\\n“I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear ’em say he’s the bloodiest looking villain\\nin this country, and they wonder he wasn’t ever hung before.”\\n\\n“Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I’ve heard ’em say that if he\\nwas to get free they’d lynch him.”\\n\\n“And they’d do it, too.”\\n\\nThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the\\ntwilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood\\nof the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that\\nsomething would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But\\nnothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in\\nthis luckless captive.\\n\\nThe boys did as they had often done before—went to the cell grating and\\ngave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and\\nthere were no guards.\\n\\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences\\nbefore—it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and\\ntreacherous to the last degree when Potter said:\\n\\n“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys—better’n anybody else in this town.\\nAnd I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I says to myself, says I, ‘I used\\nto mend all the boys’ kites and things, and show ’em where the good\\nfishin’ places was, and befriend ’em what I could, and now they’ve\\nall forgot old Muff when he’s in trouble; but Tom don’t, and Huck\\ndon’t—_they_ don’t forget him,’ says I, ‘and I don’t forget them.’ Well,\\nboys, I done an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the time—that’s the only\\nway I account for it—and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right.\\nRight, and _best_, too, I reckon—hope so, anyway. Well, we won’t talk\\nabout that. I don’t want to make _you_ feel bad; you’ve befriended me.\\nBut what I want to say, is, don’t _you_ ever get drunk—then you won’t\\never get here. Stand a litter furder west—so—that’s it; it’s a prime\\ncomfort to see faces that’s friendly when a body’s in such a muck\\nof trouble, and there don’t none come here but yourn. Good friendly\\nfaces—good friendly faces. Git up on one another’s backs and let me\\ntouch ’em. That’s it. Shake hands—yourn’ll come through the bars, but\\nmine’s too big. Little hands, and weak—but they’ve helped Muff Potter a\\npower, and they’d help him more if they could.”\\n\\nTom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.\\nThe next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an\\nalmost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.\\nHuck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.\\nEach wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination\\nalways brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers\\nsauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing\\nnews—the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor\\nPotter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect\\nthat Injun Joe’s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was\\nnot the slightest question as to what the jury’s verdict would be.\\n\\nTom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He\\nwas in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to\\nsleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for\\nthis was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented\\nin the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took\\ntheir places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and\\nhopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all\\nthe curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,\\nstolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and\\nthe sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings\\namong the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These\\ndetails and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation\\nthat was as impressive as it was fascinating.\\n\\nNow a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing\\nin the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was\\ndiscovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further\\nquestioning, counsel for the prosecution said:\\n\\n“Take the witness.”\\n\\nThe prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when\\nhis own counsel said:\\n\\n“I have no questions to ask him.”\\n\\nThe next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.\\nCounsel for the prosecution said:\\n\\n“Take the witness.”\\n\\n“I have no questions to ask him,” Potter’s lawyer replied.\\n\\nA third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter’s\\npossession.\\n\\n“Take the witness.”\\n\\nCounsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience\\nbegan to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his\\nclient’s life without an effort?\\n\\nSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Potter’s guilty behavior when\\nbrought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand\\nwithout being cross-questioned.\\n\\nEvery detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the\\ngraveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was\\nbrought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined\\nby Potter’s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house\\nexpressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.\\nCounsel for the prosecution now said:\\n\\n“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have\\nfastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the\\nunhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.”\\n\\nA groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and\\nrocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned\\nin the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women’s compassion\\ntestified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:\\n\\n“Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we\\nforeshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed\\nwhile under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced\\nby drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.” [Then\\nto the clerk:] “Call Thomas Sawyer!”\\n\\nA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting\\nPotter’s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as\\nhe rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,\\nfor he was badly scared. The oath was administered.\\n\\n“Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the\\nhour of midnight?”\\n\\nTom glanced at Injun Joe’s iron face and his tongue failed him. The\\naudience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few\\nmoments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed\\nto put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:\\n\\n“In the graveyard!”\\n\\n“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You were—”\\n\\n“In the graveyard.”\\n\\nA contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s face.\\n\\n“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Speak up—just a trifle louder. How near were you?”\\n\\n“Near as I am to you.”\\n\\n“Were you hidden, or not?”\\n\\n“I was hid.”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”\\n\\nInjun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.\\n\\n“Any one with you?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I went there with—”\\n\\n“Wait—wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion’s name. We\\nwill produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with\\nyou.”\\n\\nTom hesitated and looked confused.\\n\\n“Speak out, my boy—don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.\\nWhat did you take there?”\\n\\n“Only a—a—dead cat.”\\n\\nThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.\\n\\n“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us\\neverything that occurred—tell it in your own way—don’t skip anything,\\nand don’t be afraid.”\\n\\nTom began—hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his\\nwords flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased\\nbut his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and\\nbated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,\\nrapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent\\nemotion reached its climax when the boy said:\\n\\n“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun\\nJoe jumped with the knife and—”\\n\\nCrash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his\\nway through all opposers, and was gone!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\n\\nTom was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the\\nyoung. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper\\nmagnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,\\nif he escaped hanging.\\n\\nAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom\\nand fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort\\nof conduct is to the world’s credit; therefore it is not well to find\\nfault with it.\\n\\nTom’s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights\\nwere seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always\\nwith doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy\\nto stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of\\nwretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer\\nthe night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid\\nthat his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding\\nInjun Joe’s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.\\nThe poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of\\nthat? Since Tom’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the\\nlawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had\\nbeen sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck’s\\nconfidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.\\n\\nDaily Muff Potter’s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly\\nhe wished he had sealed up his tongue.\\n\\nHalf the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the\\nother half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a\\nsafe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.\\n\\nRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun\\nJoe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a\\ndetective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked\\nwise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that\\ncraft usually achieve. That is to say, he “found a clew.” But you can’t\\nhang a “clew” for murder, and so after that detective had got through\\nand gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.\\n\\nThe slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened\\nweight of apprehension.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\n\\nThere comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy’s life when he has\\na raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire\\nsuddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper,\\nbut failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.\\nPresently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would\\nanswer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him\\nconfidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand\\nin any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,\\nfor he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is\\nnot money. “Where’ll we dig?” said Huck.\\n\\n“Oh, most anywhere.”\\n\\n“Why, is it hid all around?”\\n\\n“No, indeed it ain’t. It’s hid in mighty particular places,\\nHuck—sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of\\na limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but\\nmostly under the floor in ha’nted houses.”\\n\\n“Who hides it?”\\n\\n“Why, robbers, of course—who’d you reckon? Sunday-school\\nsup’rintendents?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. If ’twas mine I wouldn’t hide it; I’d spend it and have a\\ngood time.”\\n\\n“So would I. But robbers don’t do that way. They always hide it and\\nleave it there.”\\n\\n“Don’t they come after it any more?”\\n\\n“No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else\\nthey die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and\\nby somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks—a\\npaper that’s got to be ciphered over about a week because it’s mostly\\nsigns and hy’roglyphics.”\\n\\n“Hyro—which?”\\n\\n“Hy’roglyphics—pictures and things, you know, that don’t seem to mean\\nanything.”\\n\\n“Have you got one of them papers, Tom?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Well then, how you going to find the marks?”\\n\\n“I don’t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha’nted house or on\\nan island, or under a dead tree that’s got one limb sticking out. Well,\\nwe’ve tried Jackson’s Island a little, and we can try it again some\\ntime; and there’s the old ha’nted house up the Still-House branch, and\\nthere’s lots of dead-limb trees—dead loads of ’em.”\\n\\n“Is it under all of them?”\\n\\n“How you talk! No!”\\n\\n“Then how you going to know which one to go for?”\\n\\n“Go for all of ’em!”\\n\\n“Why, Tom, it’ll take all summer.”\\n\\n“Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars\\nin it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di’monds. How’s\\nthat?”\\n\\nHuck’s eyes glowed.\\n\\n“That’s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred\\ndollars and I don’t want no di’monds.”\\n\\n“All right. But I bet you I ain’t going to throw off on di’monds. Some\\nof ’em’s worth twenty dollars apiece—there ain’t any, hardly, but’s\\nworth six bits or a dollar.”\\n\\n“No! Is that so?”\\n\\n“Cert’nly—anybody’ll tell you so. Hain’t you ever seen one, Huck?”\\n\\n“Not as I remember.”\\n\\n“Oh, kings have slathers of them.”\\n\\n“Well, I don’ know no kings, Tom.”\\n\\n“I reckon you don’t. But if you was to go to Europe you’d see a raft of\\n’em hopping around.”\\n\\n“Do they hop?”\\n\\n“Hop?—your granny! No!”\\n\\n“Well, what did you say they did, for?”\\n\\n“Shucks, I only meant you’d _see_ ’em—not hopping, of course—what do\\nthey want to hop for?—but I mean you’d just see ’em—scattered around,\\nyou know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.”\\n\\n“Richard? What’s his other name?”\\n\\n“He didn’t have any other name. Kings don’t have any but a given name.”\\n\\n“No?”\\n\\n“But they don’t.”\\n\\n“Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don’t want to be a king\\nand have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say—where you going\\nto dig first?”\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know. S’pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the\\nhill t’other side of Still-House branch?”\\n\\n“I’m agreed.”\\n\\nSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their\\nthree-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves\\ndown in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.\\n\\n“I like this,” said Tom.\\n\\n“So do I.”\\n\\n“Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your\\nshare?”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I’ll go to every\\ncircus that comes along. I bet I’ll have a gay time.”\\n\\n“Well, ain’t you going to save any of it?”\\n\\n“Save it? What for?”\\n\\n“Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.”\\n\\n“Oh, that ain’t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day\\nand get his claws on it if I didn’t hurry up, and I tell you he’d clean\\nit out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?”\\n\\n“I’m going to buy a new drum, and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie\\nand a bull pup, and get married.”\\n\\n“Married!”\\n\\n“That’s it.”\\n\\n“Tom, you—why, you ain’t in your right mind.”\\n\\n“Wait—you’ll see.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my\\nmother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty\\nwell.”\\n\\n“That ain’t anything. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.”\\n\\n“Tom, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all comb a body. Now you\\nbetter think ’bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What’s the name\\nof the gal?”\\n\\n“It ain’t a gal at all—it’s a girl.”\\n\\n“It’s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl—both’s\\nright, like enough. Anyway, what’s her name, Tom?”\\n\\n“I’ll tell you some time—not now.”\\n\\n“All right—that’ll do. Only if you get married I’ll be more lonesomer\\nthan ever.”\\n\\n“No you won’t. You’ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and\\nwe’ll go to digging.”\\n\\nThey worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another\\nhalfhour. Still no result. Huck said:\\n\\n“Do they always bury it as deep as this?”\\n\\n“Sometimes—not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven’t got the right\\nplace.”\\n\\nSo they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,\\nbut still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.\\nFinally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his\\nbrow with his sleeve, and said:\\n\\n“Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?”\\n\\n“I reckon maybe we’ll tackle the old tree that’s over yonder on Cardiff\\nHill back of the widow’s.”\\n\\n“I reckon that’ll be a good one. But won’t the widow take it away from\\nus, Tom? It’s on her land.”\\n\\n“_She_ take it away! Maybe she’d like to try it once. Whoever finds one\\nof these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don’t make any difference\\nwhose land it’s on.”\\n\\nThat was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:\\n\\n“Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?”\\n\\n“It is mighty curious, Huck. I don’t understand it. Sometimes witches\\ninterfere. I reckon maybe that’s what’s the trouble now.”\\n\\n“Shucks! Witches ain’t got no power in the daytime.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s so. I didn’t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!\\nWhat a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow\\nof the limb falls at midnight, and that’s where you dig!”\\n\\n“Then consound it, we’ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang\\nit all, we got to come back in the night. It’s an awful long way. Can\\nyou get out?”\\n\\n“I bet I will. We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees\\nthese holes they’ll know in a minute what’s here and they’ll go for it.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll come around and maow tonight.”\\n\\n“All right. Let’s hide the tools in the bushes.”\\n\\nThe boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in\\nthe shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by\\nold traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked\\nin the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the\\ndistance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were\\nsubdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged\\nthat twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to\\ndig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and\\ntheir industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,\\nbut every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon\\nsomething, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone\\nor a chunk. At last Tom said:\\n\\n“It ain’t any use, Huck, we’re wrong again.”\\n\\n“Well, but we _can’t_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”\\n\\n“I know it, but then there’s another thing.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too\\nearly.”\\n\\nHuck dropped his shovel.\\n\\n“That’s it,” said he. “That’s the very trouble. We got to give this one\\nup. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s\\ntoo awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering\\naround so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time; and I’m\\nafeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for\\na chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a\\ndead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.”\\n\\n“Lordy!”\\n\\n“Yes, they do. I’ve always heard that.”\\n\\n“Tom, I don’t like to fool around much where there’s dead people. A\\nbody’s bound to get into trouble with ’em, sure.”\\n\\n“I don’t like to stir ’em up, either. S’pose this one here was to stick\\nhis skull out and say something!”\\n\\n“Don’t Tom! It’s awful.”\\n\\n“Well, it just is. Huck, I don’t feel comfortable a bit.”\\n\\n“Say, Tom, let’s give this place up, and try somewheres else.”\\n\\n“All right, I reckon we better.”\\n\\n“What’ll it be?”\\n\\nTom considered awhile; and then said:\\n\\n“The ha’nted house. That’s it!”\\n\\n“Blame it, I don’t like ha’nted houses, Tom. Why, they’re a dern sight\\nworse’n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don’t come\\nsliding around in a shroud, when you ain’t noticing, and peep over your\\nshoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I\\ncouldn’t stand such a thing as that, Tom—nobody could.”\\n\\n“Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don’t travel around only at night. They won’t\\nhender us from digging there in the daytime.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s so. But you know mighty well people don’t go about that\\nha’nted house in the day nor the night.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been\\nmurdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except\\nin the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular\\nghosts.”\\n\\n“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,\\nyou can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.\\nBecuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s so. But anyway they don’t come around in the daytime, so\\nwhat’s the use of our being afeard?”\\n\\n“Well, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so—but I\\nreckon it’s taking chances.”\\n\\nThey had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the\\nmoonlit valley below them stood the “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated,\\nits fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the\\nchimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof\\ncaved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit\\npast a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the\\ncircumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted\\nhouse a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that\\nadorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\n\\nAbout noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come\\nfor their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was\\nmeasurably so, also—but suddenly said:\\n\\n“Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?”\\n\\nTom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his\\neyes with a startled look in them—\\n\\n“My! I never once thought of it, Huck!”\\n\\n“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was\\nFriday.”\\n\\n“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got into an\\nawful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”\\n\\n“_Might_! Better say we _would_! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but\\nFriday ain’t.”\\n\\n“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon _you_ was the first that found it\\nout, Huck.”\\n\\n“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a\\nrotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”\\n\\n“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that\\nthere’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty\\nsharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do\\nyou know Robin Hood, Huck?”\\n\\n“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”\\n\\n“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the\\nbest. He was a robber.”\\n\\n“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”\\n\\n“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But\\nhe never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em\\nperfectly square.”\\n\\n“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”\\n\\n“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.\\nThey ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in\\nEngland, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow\\nand plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”\\n\\n“What’s a _yew_ bow?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that\\ndime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll\\nplay Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”\\n\\n“I’m agreed.”\\n\\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a\\nyearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the\\nmorrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink\\ninto the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows\\nof the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff\\nHill.\\n\\nOn Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.\\nThey had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their\\nlast hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were\\nso many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down\\nwithin six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and\\nturned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this\\ntime, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling\\nthat they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the\\nrequirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\\n\\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and\\ngrisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,\\nand something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the\\nplace, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they\\ncrept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,\\nfloorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,\\na ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and\\nabandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened\\npulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,\\nand muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\\n\\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the\\nplace a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own\\nboldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.\\nThis was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring\\neach other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their\\ntools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of\\ndecay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the\\npromise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now\\nand well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when—\\n\\n“Sh!” said Tom.\\n\\n“What is it?” whispered Huck, blanching with fright.\\n\\n“Sh!... There!... Hear it?”\\n\\n“Yes!... Oh, my! Let’s run!”\\n\\n“Keep still! Don’t you budge! They’re coming right toward the door.”\\n\\nThe boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to\\nknotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.\\n\\n“They’ve stopped.... No—coming.... Here they are. Don’t whisper another\\nword, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!”\\n\\nTwo men entered. Each boy said to himself: “There’s the old deaf and\\ndumb Spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately—never saw\\nt’other man before.”\\n\\n“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant\\nin his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white\\nwhiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore\\ngreen goggles. When they came in, “t’other” was talking in a low voice;\\nthey sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the\\nwall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less\\nguarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:\\n\\n“No,” said he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t like it. It’s\\ndangerous.”\\n\\n“Dangerous!” grunted the “deaf and dumb” Spaniard—to the vast surprise\\nof the boys. “Milksop!”\\n\\nThis voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe’s! There was\\nsilence for some time. Then Joe said:\\n\\n“What’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing’s come of\\nit.”\\n\\n“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.\\n’Twon’t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn’t succeed.”\\n\\n“Well, what’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody\\nwould suspicion us that saw us.”\\n\\n“I know that. But there warn’t any other place as handy after that fool\\nof a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it\\nwarn’t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys\\nplaying over there on the hill right in full view.”\\n\\n“Those infernal boys” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,\\nand thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and\\nconcluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a\\nyear.\\n\\nThe two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and\\nthoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:\\n\\n“Look here, lad—you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there\\ntill you hear from me. I’ll take the chances on dropping into this town\\njust once more, for a look. We’ll do that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve\\nspied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!\\nWe’ll leg it together!”\\n\\nThis was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe\\nsaid:\\n\\n“I’m dead for sleep! It’s your turn to watch.”\\n\\nHe curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred\\nhim once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to\\nnod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.\\n\\nThe boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:\\n\\n“Now’s our chance—come!”\\n\\nHuck said:\\n\\n“I can’t—I’d die if they was to wake.”\\n\\nTom urged—Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and\\nstarted alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak\\nfrom the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never\\nmade a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments\\ntill it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;\\nand then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.\\n\\nNow one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon\\nhis comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up with\\nhis foot and said:\\n\\n“Here! _You’re_ a watchman, ain’t you! All right, though—nothing’s\\nhappened.”\\n\\n“My! have I been asleep?”\\n\\n“Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What’ll we\\ndo with what little swag we’ve got left?”\\n\\n“I don’t know—leave it here as we’ve always done, I reckon. No use to\\ntake it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver’s\\nsomething to carry.”\\n\\n“Well—all right—it won’t matter to come here once more.”\\n\\n“No—but I’d say come in the night as we used to do—it’s better.”\\n\\n“Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right\\nchance at that job; accidents might happen; ’tain’t in such a very good\\nplace; we’ll just regularly bury it—and bury it deep.”\\n\\n“Good idea,” said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,\\nraised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled\\npleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself\\nand as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on\\nhis knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.\\n\\nThe boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With\\ngloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!—the splendor of it was\\nbeyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make\\nhalf a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest\\nauspices—there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to\\ndig. They nudged each other every moment—eloquent nudges and easily\\nunderstood, for they simply meant—“Oh, but ain’t you glad _now_ we’re\\nhere!”\\n\\nJoe’s knife struck upon something.\\n\\n“Hello!” said he.\\n\\n“What is it?” said his comrade.\\n\\n“Half-rotten plank—no, it’s a box, I believe. Here—bear a hand and we’ll\\nsee what it’s here for. Never mind, I’ve broke a hole.”\\n\\nHe reached his hand in and drew it out—\\n\\n“Man, it’s money!”\\n\\nThe two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys\\nabove were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.\\n\\nJoe’s comrade said:\\n\\n“We’ll make quick work of this. There’s an old rusty pick over amongst\\nthe weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace—I saw it a\\nminute ago.”\\n\\nHe ran and brought the boys’ pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the\\npick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to\\nhimself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was\\nnot very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the\\nslow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in\\nblissful silence.\\n\\n“Pard, there’s thousands of dollars here,” said Injun Joe.\\n\\n“’Twas always said that Murrel’s gang used to be around here one\\nsummer,” the stranger observed.\\n\\n“I know it,” said Injun Joe; “and this looks like it, I should say.”\\n\\n“Now you won’t need to do that job.”\\n\\nThe halfbreed frowned. Said he:\\n\\n“You don’t know me. Least you don’t know all about that thing. ’Tain’t\\nrobbery altogether—it’s _revenge_!” and a wicked light flamed in his\\neyes. “I’ll need your help in it. When it’s finished—then Texas. Go home\\nto your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.”\\n\\n“Well—if you say so; what’ll we do with this—bury it again?”\\n\\n“Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! by the great Sachem, no!\\n[Profound distress overhead.] I’d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh\\nearth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business\\nhas a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on\\nthem? Who brought them here—and where are they gone? Have you heard\\nanybody?—seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and\\nsee the ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We’ll take it to my\\nden.”\\n\\n“Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number\\nOne?”\\n\\n“No—Number Two—under the cross. The other place is bad—too common.”\\n\\n“All right. It’s nearly dark enough to start.”\\n\\nInjun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping\\nout. Presently he said:\\n\\n“Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be\\nupstairs?”\\n\\nThe boys’ breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,\\nhalted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The\\nboys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came\\ncreaking up the stairs—the intolerable distress of the situation woke\\nthe stricken resolution of the lads—they were about to spring for the\\ncloset, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on\\nthe ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself\\nup cursing, and his comrade said:\\n\\n“Now what’s the use of all that? If it’s anybody, and they’re up there,\\nlet them _stay_ there—who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get\\ninto trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes—and then\\nlet them follow us if they want to. I’m willing. In my opinion, whoever\\nhove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or\\ndevils or something. I’ll bet they’re running yet.”\\n\\nJoe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight\\nwas left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.\\nShortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening\\ntwilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.\\n\\nTom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them\\nthrough the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They\\nwere content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the\\ntownward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much\\nabsorbed in hating themselves—hating the ill luck that made them take\\nthe spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have\\nsuspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait\\nthere till his “revenge” was satisfied, and then he would have had the\\nmisfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that\\nthe tools were ever brought there!\\n\\nThey resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to\\ntown spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to\\n“Number Two,” wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to\\nTom.\\n\\n“Revenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t!” said Huck, nearly fainting.\\n\\nThey talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe\\nthat he might possibly mean somebody else—at least that he might at\\nleast mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.\\n\\nVery, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company\\nwould be a palpable improvement, he thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\n\\n\\nThe adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom’s dreams that night.\\nFour times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times\\nit wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and\\nwakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay\\nin the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he\\nnoticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away—somewhat as if\\nthey had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it\\noccurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There\\nwas one very strong argument in favor of this idea—namely, that the\\nquantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen\\nas much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of\\nhis age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to\\n“hundreds” and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that\\nno such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for\\na moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in\\nactual money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure\\nhad been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of\\nreal dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.\\n\\nBut the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer\\nunder the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found\\nhimself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a\\ndream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a\\nhurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale\\nof a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking\\nvery melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If\\nhe did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a\\ndream.\\n\\n“Hello, Huck!”\\n\\n“Hello, yourself.”\\n\\nSilence, for a minute.\\n\\n“Tom, if we’d ’a’ left the blame tools at the dead tree, we’d ’a’ got\\nthe money. Oh, ain’t it awful!”\\n\\n“’Tain’t a dream, then, ’tain’t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.\\nDog’d if I don’t, Huck.”\\n\\n“What ain’t a dream?”\\n\\n“Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.”\\n\\n“Dream! If them stairs hadn’t broke down you’d ’a’ seen how much dream\\nit was! I’ve had dreams enough all night—with that patch-eyed Spanish\\ndevil going for me all through ’em—rot him!”\\n\\n“No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!”\\n\\n“Tom, we’ll never find him. A feller don’t have only one chance for such\\na pile—and that one’s lost. I’d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,\\nanyway.”\\n\\n“Well, so’d I; but I’d like to see him, anyway—and track him out—to his\\nNumber Two.”\\n\\n“Number Two—yes, that’s it. I been thinking ’bout that. But I can’t make\\nnothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?”\\n\\n“I dono. It’s too deep. Say, Huck—maybe it’s the number of a house!”\\n\\n“Goody!... No, Tom, that ain’t it. If it is, it ain’t in this one-horse\\ntown. They ain’t no numbers here.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s so. Lemme think a minute. Here—it’s the number of a\\nroom—in a tavern, you know!”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s the trick! They ain’t only two taverns. We can find out\\nquick.”\\n\\n“You stay here, Huck, till I come.”\\n\\nTom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck’s company in public\\nplaces. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.\\n2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.\\nIn the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper’s\\nyoung son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody\\ngo into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any\\nparticular reason for this state of things; had had some little\\ncuriosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery\\nby entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “ha’nted”; had\\nnoticed that there was a light in there the night before.\\n\\n“That’s what I’ve found out, Huck. I reckon that’s the very No. 2 we’re\\nafter.”\\n\\n“I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?”\\n\\n“Lemme think.”\\n\\nTom thought a long time. Then he said:\\n\\n“I’ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out\\ninto that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap\\nof a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and\\nI’ll nip all of auntie’s, and the first dark night we’ll go there and\\ntry ’em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he\\nwas going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get\\nhis revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don’t go to\\nthat No. 2, that ain’t the place.”\\n\\n“Lordy, I don’t want to foller him by myself!”\\n\\n“Why, it’ll be night, sure. He mightn’t ever see you—and if he did,\\nmaybe he’d never think anything.”\\n\\n“Well, if it’s pretty dark I reckon I’ll track him. I dono—I dono. I’ll\\ntry.”\\n\\n“You bet I’ll follow him, if it’s dark, Huck. Why, he might ’a’ found\\nout he couldn’t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.”\\n\\n“It’s so, Tom, it’s so. I’ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!”\\n\\n“Now you’re _talking_! Don’t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won’t.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\n\\n\\nThat night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about\\nthe neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley\\nat a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or\\nleft it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern\\ndoor. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the\\nunderstanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck\\nwas to come and “maow,” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.\\nBut the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to\\nbed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\\n\\nTuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday\\nnight promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt’s\\nold tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the\\nlantern in Huck’s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before\\nmidnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)\\nwere put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the\\nalley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,\\nthe perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of\\ndistant thunder.\\n\\nTom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the\\ntowel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.\\nHuck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was\\na season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck’s spirits like a\\nmountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern—it\\nwould frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive\\nyet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have\\nfainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and\\nexcitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer\\nand closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and\\nmomentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away\\nhis breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to\\ninhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the\\nway it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came\\ntearing by him: “Run!” said he; “run, for your life!”\\n\\nHe needn’t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or\\nforty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never\\nstopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the\\nlower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm\\nburst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:\\n\\n“Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;\\nbut they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn’t hardly\\nget my breath I was so scared. They wouldn’t turn in the lock, either.\\nWell, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and\\nopen comes the door! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the\\ntowel, and, _Great Caesar’s Ghost!_”\\n\\n“What!—what’d you see, Tom?”\\n\\n“Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe’s hand!”\\n\\n“No!”\\n\\n“Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch\\non his eye and his arms spread out.”\\n\\n“Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?”\\n\\n“No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and\\nstarted!”\\n\\n“I’d never ’a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”\\n\\n“Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”\\n\\n“Say, Tom, did you see that box?”\\n\\n“Huck, I didn’t wait to look around. I didn’t see the box, I didn’t see\\nthe cross. I didn’t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor\\nby Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.\\nDon’t you see, now, what’s the matter with that ha’nted room?”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“Why, it’s ha’nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have\\ngot a ha’nted room, hey, Huck?”\\n\\n“Well, I reckon maybe that’s so. Who’d ’a’ thought such a thing? But\\nsay, Tom, now’s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe’s\\ndrunk.”\\n\\n“It is, that! You try it!”\\n\\nHuck shuddered.\\n\\n“Well, no—I reckon not.”\\n\\n“And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain’t\\nenough. If there’d been three, he’d be drunk enough and I’d do it.”\\n\\nThere was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:\\n\\n“Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun\\nJoe’s not in there. It’s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we’ll\\nbe dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we’ll\\nsnatch that box quicker’n lightning.”\\n\\n“Well, I’m agreed. I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every\\nnight, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”\\n\\n“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a\\nblock and maow—and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window\\nand that’ll fetch me.”\\n\\n“Agreed, and good as wheat!”\\n\\n“Now, Huck, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be\\ndaylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will\\nyou?”\\n\\n“I said I would, Tom, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for\\na year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”\\n\\n“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”\\n\\n“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man,\\nUncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any\\ntime I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.\\nThat’s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as\\nif I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat _with_ him. But\\nyou needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry\\nhe wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”\\n\\n“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t\\ncome bothering around. Any time you see something’s up, in the night,\\njust skip right around and maow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\n\\n\\nThe first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of\\nnews—Judge Thatcher’s family had come back to town the night before.\\nBoth Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a\\nmoment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her\\nand they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”\\n with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in\\na peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint\\nthe next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she\\nconsented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more\\nmoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway\\nthe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation\\nand pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep\\nawake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s\\n“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers\\nwith, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.\\n\\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and\\nrollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was\\nready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the\\npicnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough\\nunder the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young\\ngentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was\\nchartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main\\nstreet laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss\\nthe fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.\\nThatcher said to Becky, was:\\n\\n“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with\\nsome of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”\\n\\n“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”\\n\\n“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”\\n\\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\\n\\n“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll\\nclimb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have\\nice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be\\nawful glad to have us.”\\n\\n“Oh, that will be fun!”\\n\\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:\\n\\n“But what will mamma say?”\\n\\n“How’ll she ever know?”\\n\\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\\n\\n“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”\\n\\n“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she\\nwants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if\\nshe’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”\\n\\nThe Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and\\nTom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say\\nnothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to\\nTom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The\\nthought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he\\ncould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he\\ngive it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so\\nwhy should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the\\nevening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined\\nto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of\\nthe box of money another time that day.\\n\\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\\nhollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest\\ndistances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and\\nlaughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone\\nthrough with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified\\nwith responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things\\nbegan. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in\\nthe shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\\n\\n“Who’s ready for the cave?”\\n\\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there\\nwas a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the\\nhillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood\\nunbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled\\nby Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was\\nromantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out\\nupon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the\\nsituation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment\\na candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a\\nstruggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked\\ndown or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a\\nnew chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went\\nfiling down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of\\nlights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of\\njunction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than\\neight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower\\ncrevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a\\nvast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again\\nand led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights\\ntogether through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never\\nfind the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and\\nstill down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under\\nlabyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was\\nan impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it\\nwas not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer\\nknew as much of the cave as any one.\\n\\nThe procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of\\na mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch\\navenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise\\nat points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude\\neach other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the\\n“known” ground.\\n\\nBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth\\nof the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow\\ndrippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of\\nthe day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking\\nno note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had\\nbeen calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s\\nadventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat\\nwith her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for\\nthe wasted time but the captain of the craft.\\n\\nHuck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went\\nglinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young\\npeople were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly\\ntired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not\\nstop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his\\nattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten\\no’clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\\nto wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\\nbetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\\nsilence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the tavern lights were\\nput out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long\\ntime, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?\\nWas there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?\\n\\nA noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley\\ndoor closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next\\nmoment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under\\nhis arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.\\nWhy call Tom now? It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box\\nand never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow\\nthem; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So\\ncommuning with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the\\nmen, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough\\nahead not to be invisible.\\n\\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up\\na crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the\\npath that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old\\nWelshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still\\nclimbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.\\nBut they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.\\nThey plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and\\nwere at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his\\ndistance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along\\nawhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved\\non a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that\\nhe seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an\\nowl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was\\neverything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man\\ncleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his\\nthroat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as\\nif a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he\\nthought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He\\nknew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’\\ngrounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard\\nto find.\\n\\nNow there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe’s:\\n\\n“Damn her, maybe she’s got company—there’s lights, late as it is.”\\n\\n“I can’t see any.”\\n\\nThis was that stranger’s voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A\\ndeadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His\\nthought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been\\nkind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder\\nher. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t\\ndare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in\\nthe moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s\\nnext—which was—\\n\\n“Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?”\\n\\n“Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”\\n\\n“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and\\nmaybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you\\nbefore, I don’t care for her swag—you may have it. But her husband was\\nrough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice\\nof the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t\\na millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!—horsewhipped in\\nfront of the jail, like a nigger!—with all the town looking on!\\n_Horsewhipped_!—do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But\\nI’ll take it out of _her_.”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”\\n\\n“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was\\nhere; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t\\nkill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her\\nears like a sow!”\\n\\n“By God, that’s—”\\n\\n“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her\\nto the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if\\nshe does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for _my_ sake—that’s\\nwhy you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you.\\nDo you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and\\nthen I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”\\n\\n“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the\\nbetter—I’m all in a shiver.”\\n\\n“Do it _now_? And company there? Look here—I’ll get suspicious of you,\\nfirst thing you know. No—we’ll wait till the lights are out—there’s no\\nhurry.”\\n\\nHuck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful\\nthan any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped\\ngingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,\\none-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one\\nside and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same\\nelaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and—a twig\\nsnapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no\\nsound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he\\nturned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—turned\\nhimself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but\\ncautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and\\nso he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he\\nreached the Welshman’s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads\\nof the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.\\n\\n“What’s the row there? Who’s banging? What do you want?”\\n\\n“Let me in—quick! I’ll tell everything.”\\n\\n“Why, who are you?”\\n\\n“Huckleberry Finn—quick, let me in!”\\n\\n“Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain’t a name to open many doors, I judge!\\nBut let him in, lads, and let’s see what’s the trouble.”\\n\\n“Please don’t ever tell I told you,” were Huck’s first words when he got\\nin. “Please don’t—I’d be killed, sure—but the widow’s been good friends\\nto me sometimes, and I want to tell—I _will_ tell if you’ll promise you\\nwon’t ever say it was me.”\\n\\n“By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn’t act so!”\\n exclaimed the old man; “out with it and nobody here’ll ever tell, lad.”\\n\\nThree minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the\\nhill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in\\ntheir hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great\\nbowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and\\nthen all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.\\n\\nHuck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as\\nfast as his legs could carry him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX\\n\\n\\nAs the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came\\ngroping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s door. The\\ninmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,\\non account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a\\nwindow:\\n\\n“Who’s there!”\\n\\nHuck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:\\n\\n“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”\\n\\n“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!”\\n\\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest\\nhe had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever\\nbeen applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he\\nentered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall\\nsons speedily dressed themselves.\\n\\n“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be\\nready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too—make\\nyourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop\\nhere last night.”\\n\\n“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols\\nwent off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted\\nto know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t\\nwant to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”\\n\\n“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it—but\\nthere’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they\\nain’t dead, lad—we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right\\nwhere to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along\\non tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that\\nsumach path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the\\nmeanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—’twas bound to\\ncome, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when\\nthe sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,\\nI sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling\\nwas. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and\\nwe after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.\\nThey fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by\\nand didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet\\nwe quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a\\nposse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it\\nis light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys\\nwill be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of\\nthose rascals—’twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they\\nwere like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”\\n\\n“Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!”\\n\\n“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or\\ntwice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged—”\\n\\n“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back\\nof the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and\\ntell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”\\n\\nThe Welshman’s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck\\nsprang up and exclaimed:\\n\\n“Oh, please don’t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,\\nplease!”\\n\\n“All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what\\nyou did.”\\n\\n“Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!”\\n\\nWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:\\n\\n“They won’t tell—and I won’t. But why don’t you want it known?”\\n\\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too\\nmuch about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew\\nanything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing\\nit, sure.\\n\\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:\\n\\n“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking\\nsuspicious?”\\n\\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:\\n\\n“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and\\nI don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account\\nof thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of\\ndoing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I\\ncome along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I\\ngot to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed\\nup agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes\\nthese two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their\\narm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one\\nwanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up\\ntheir faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,\\nby his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a\\nrusty, ragged-looking devil.”\\n\\n“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”\\n\\nThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”\\n\\n“Then they went on, and you—”\\n\\n“Follered ’em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked\\nalong so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and\\nheard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d\\nspile her looks just as I told you and your two—”\\n\\n“What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!”\\n\\nHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep\\nthe old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,\\nand yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of\\nall he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,\\nbut the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.\\nPresently the Welshman said:\\n\\n“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for\\nall the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you. This Spaniard is\\nnot deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t\\ncover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want\\nto keep dark. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t\\nbetray you.”\\n\\nHuck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and\\nwhispered in his ear:\\n\\n“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”\\n\\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:\\n\\n“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and\\nslitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because\\nwhite men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a\\ndifferent matter altogether.”\\n\\nDuring breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man\\nsaid that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going\\nto bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for\\nmarks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of—\\n\\n“Of _what_?”\\n\\nIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more\\nstunning suddenness from Huck’s blanched lips. His eyes were staring\\nwide, now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman\\nstarted—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied:\\n\\n“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the _matter_ with you?”\\n\\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The\\nWelshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said:\\n\\n“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what\\ndid give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we’d found?”\\n\\nHuck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have\\ngiven anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested\\nitself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless\\nreply offered—there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered\\nit—feebly:\\n\\n“Sunday-school books, maybe.”\\n\\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and\\njoyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and\\nended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man’s pocket, because\\nit cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:\\n\\n“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder\\nyou’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it.\\nRest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”\\n\\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such\\na suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel\\nbrought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the\\ntalk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,\\nhowever—he had not known that it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a\\ncaptured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole\\nhe felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all\\nquestion that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was\\nat rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be\\ndrifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still\\nin No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and\\nTom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of\\ninterruption.\\n\\nJust as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck\\njumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even\\nremotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and\\ngentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of\\ncitizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news\\nhad spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the\\nvisitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\\n\\n“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more\\nbeholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me\\nto tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”\\n\\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the\\nmain matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his\\nvisitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he\\nrefused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the\\nwidow said:\\n\\n“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that\\nnoise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”\\n\\n“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come\\nagain—they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of\\nwaking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard\\nat your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”\\n\\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple\\nof hours more.\\n\\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody\\nwas early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came\\nthat not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the\\nsermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.\\nHarper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:\\n\\n“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired\\nto death.”\\n\\n“Your Becky?”\\n\\n“Yes,” with a startled look—“didn’t she stay with you last night?”\\n\\n“Why, no.”\\n\\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,\\ntalking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:\\n\\n“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy\\nthat’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last\\nnight—one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to\\nsettle with him.”\\n\\nMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\\n\\n“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A\\nmarked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.\\n\\n“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”\\n\\n“No’m.”\\n\\n“When did you see him last?”\\n\\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had\\nstopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding\\nuneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously\\nquestioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed\\nwhether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;\\nit was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One\\nyoung man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!\\nMrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her\\nhands.\\n\\nThe alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to\\nstreet, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and\\nthe whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant\\ninsignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs\\nwere manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half\\nan hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward\\nthe cave.\\n\\nAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women\\nvisited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They\\ncried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the\\ntedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at\\nlast, all the word that came was, “Send more candles—and send food.”\\n Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher\\nsent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed\\nno real cheer.\\n\\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with\\ncandle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck\\nstill in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with\\nfever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came\\nand took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,\\nbecause, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s,\\nand nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The\\nWelshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:\\n\\n“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off.\\nHe never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his\\nhands.”\\n\\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the\\nvillage, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the\\nnews that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being\\nransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and\\ncrevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered\\nthrough the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither\\nand thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their\\nhollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,\\nfar from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY &\\nTOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and\\nnear at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the\\nribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever\\nhave of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so\\nprecious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the\\nawful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away\\nspeck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst\\nforth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a\\nsickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;\\nit was only a searcher’s light.\\n\\nThree dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and\\nthe village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.\\nThe accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the\\nTemperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the\\npublic pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck\\nfeebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—dimly\\ndreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance\\nTavern since he had been ill.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the widow.\\n\\nHuck started up in bed, wildeyed:\\n\\n“What? What was it?”\\n\\n“Liquor!—and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child—what a turn you\\ndid give me!”\\n\\n“Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer\\nthat found it?”\\n\\nThe widow burst into tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I’ve told you\\nbefore, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!”\\n\\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great\\npowwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone\\nforever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should\\ncry.\\n\\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the\\nweariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:\\n\\n“There—he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody\\ncould find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t many left, now, that’s got hope\\nenough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\n\\n\\nNow to return to Tom and Becky’s share in the picnic. They tripped along\\nthe murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar\\nwonders of the cave—wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,\\nsuch as “The Drawing-Room,” “The Cathedral,” “Aladdin’s Palace,” and\\nso on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky\\nengaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle\\nwearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their\\ncandles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,\\npostoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been\\nfrescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they\\nscarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls\\nwere not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging\\nshelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream\\nof water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with\\nit, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara\\nin gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind\\nit in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification. He found that\\nit curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between\\nnarrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.\\n\\nBecky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future\\nguidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,\\nfar down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and\\nbranched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In\\none place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a\\nmultitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of\\na man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and\\npresently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into\\nit. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was\\nincrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst\\nof a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which\\nhad been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites\\ntogether, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the\\nroof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a\\nbunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by\\nhundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their\\nways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and\\nhurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for\\na bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out\\nof the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the\\nfugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got\\nrid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,\\nwhich stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the\\nshadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would\\nbe best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the\\ndeep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the\\nchildren. Becky said:\\n\\n“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of\\nthe others.”\\n\\n“Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them—and I don’t know how\\nfar away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t hear\\nthem here.”\\n\\nBecky grew apprehensive.\\n\\n“I wonder how long we’ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.”\\n\\n“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”\\n\\n“Can you find the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”\\n\\n“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles\\nout it will be an awful fix. Let’s try some other way, so as not to go\\nthrough there.”\\n\\n“Well. But I hope we won’t get lost. It would be so awful!” and the girl\\nshuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.\\n\\nThey started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long\\nway, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar\\nabout the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an\\nexamination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he\\nwould say cheerily:\\n\\n“Oh, it’s all right. This ain’t the one, but we’ll come to it right\\naway!”\\n\\nBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began\\nto turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of\\nfinding the one that was wanted. He still said it was “all right,” but\\nthere was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their\\nring and sounded just as if he had said, “All is lost!” Becky clung to\\nhis side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,\\nbut they would come. At last she said:\\n\\n“Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let’s go back that way! We seem to get\\nworse and worse off all the time.”\\n\\n“Listen!” said he.\\n\\nProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were\\nconspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down\\nthe empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that\\nresembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,” said Becky.\\n\\n“It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,” and\\nhe shouted again.\\n\\nThe “might” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so\\nconfessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but\\nthere was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried\\nhis steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his\\nmanner revealed another fearful fact to Becky—he could not find his way\\nback!\\n\\n“Oh, Tom, you didn’t make any marks!”\\n\\n“Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to\\ncome back! No—I can’t find the way. It’s all mixed up.”\\n\\n“Tom, Tom, we’re lost! we’re lost! We never can get out of this awful\\nplace! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!”\\n\\nShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom\\nwas appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He\\nsat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in\\nhis bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing\\nregrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom\\nbegged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell\\nto blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable\\nsituation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope\\nagain, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he\\nwould not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,\\nshe said.\\n\\nSo they moved on again—aimlessly—simply at random—all they could do\\nwas to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of\\nreviving—not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its\\nnature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and\\nfamiliarity with failure.\\n\\nBy-and-by Tom took Becky’s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so\\nmuch! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.\\nShe knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his\\npockets—yet he must economize.\\n\\nBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay\\nattention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was\\ngrown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,\\nwas at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to\\ninvite death and shorten its pursuit.\\n\\nAt last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.\\nTom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,\\nand the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom\\ntried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements\\nwere grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore\\nso heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.\\nHe sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural\\nunder the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and\\nrested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing\\ninto his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and\\ndreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a\\nbreezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan\\nfollowed it.\\n\\n“Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I\\ndon’t, Tom! Don’t look so! I won’t say it again.”\\n\\n“I’m glad you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll feel rested, now, and we’ll find\\nthe way out.”\\n\\n“We can try, Tom; but I’ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I\\nreckon we are going there.”\\n\\n“Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let’s go on trying.”\\n\\nThey rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried\\nto estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was\\nthat it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not\\nbe, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this—they\\ncould not tell how long—Tom said they must go softly and listen for\\ndripping water—they must find a spring. They found one presently, and\\nTom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky\\nsaid she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to\\nhear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom\\nfastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought\\nwas soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the\\nsilence:\\n\\n“Tom, I am so hungry!”\\n\\nTom took something out of his pocket.\\n\\n“Do you remember this?” said he.\\n\\nBecky almost smiled.\\n\\n“It’s our wedding-cake, Tom.”\\n\\n“Yes—I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it’s all we’ve got.”\\n\\n“I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup\\npeople do with wedding-cake—but it’ll be our—”\\n\\nShe dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky\\nate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was\\nabundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky\\nsuggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?”\\n\\nBecky’s face paled, but she thought she could.\\n\\n“Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there’s water to drink.\\nThat little piece is our last candle!”\\n\\nBecky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort\\nher, but with little effect. At length Becky said:\\n\\n“Tom!”\\n\\n“Well, Becky?”\\n\\n“They’ll miss us and hunt for us!”\\n\\n“Yes, they will! Certainly they will!”\\n\\n“Maybe they’re hunting for us now, Tom.”\\n\\n“Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.”\\n\\n“When would they miss us, Tom?”\\n\\n“When they get back to the boat, I reckon.”\\n\\n“Tom, it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn’t come?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they\\ngot home.”\\n\\nA frightened look in Becky’s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw\\nthat he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!\\nThe children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of\\ngrief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers\\nalso—that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher\\ndiscovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper’s.\\n\\nThe children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it\\nmelt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone\\nat last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of\\nsmoke, linger at its top a moment, and then—the horror of utter darkness\\nreigned!\\n\\nHow long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that\\nshe was crying in Tom’s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew\\nwas, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of\\na dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said\\nit might be Sunday, now—maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but\\nher sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that\\nthey must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going\\non. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in\\nthe darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no\\nmore.\\n\\nThe hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A\\nportion of Tom’s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But\\nthey seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted\\ndesire.\\n\\nBy-and-by Tom said:\\n\\n“SH! Did you hear that?”\\n\\nBoth held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the\\nfaintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by\\nthe hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently\\nhe listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little\\nnearer.\\n\\n“It’s them!” said Tom; “they’re coming! Come along, Becky—we’re all\\nright now!”\\n\\nThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,\\nhowever, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded\\nagainst. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three\\nfeet deep, it might be a hundred—there was no passing it at any rate.\\nTom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No\\nbottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They\\nlistened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!\\na moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking\\nmisery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He\\ntalked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no\\nsounds came again.\\n\\nThe children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged\\non; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed\\nit must be Tuesday by this time.\\n\\nNow an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It\\nwould be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the\\nheavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to\\na projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the\\nline as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended\\nin a “jumping-off place.” Tom got down on his knees and felt below,\\nand then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands\\nconveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the\\nright, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding\\na candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,\\nand instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun\\nJoe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the\\nnext moment, to see the “Spaniard” take to his heels and get himself out\\nof sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come\\nover and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have\\ndisguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s\\nfright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he\\nhad strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and\\nnothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He\\nwas careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he\\nhad only shouted “for luck.”\\n\\nBut hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.\\nAnother tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought\\nchanges. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed\\nthat it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,\\nand that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another\\npassage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But\\nBecky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be\\nroused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die—it would\\nnot be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he\\nchose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak\\nto her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would\\nstay by her and hold her hand until all was over.\\n\\nTom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show\\nof being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;\\nthen he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the\\npassages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with\\nbodings of coming doom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\n\\n\\nTuesday afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.\\nPetersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public\\nprayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer\\nthat had the petitioner’s whole heart in it; but still no good news came\\nfrom the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest\\nand gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the\\nchildren could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great\\npart of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her\\ncall her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,\\nthen lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into\\na settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The\\nvillage went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.\\n\\nAway in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village\\nbells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad\\npeople, who shouted, “Turn out! turn out! they’re found! they’re found!”\\n Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself\\nand moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage\\ndrawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward\\nmarch, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after\\nhuzzah!\\n\\nThe village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the\\ngreatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour\\na procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher’s house, seized\\nthe saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, tried to\\nspeak but couldn’t—and drifted out raining tears all over the place.\\n\\nAunt Polly’s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher’s nearly so. It\\nwould be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the\\ngreat news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon\\na sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the\\nwonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it\\nwithal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went\\non an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his\\nkite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch\\nof the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off\\nspeck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,\\npushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad\\nMississippi rolling by!\\n\\nAnd if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that\\nspeck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He\\ntold how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told\\nhim not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was\\ngoing to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and\\nconvinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to\\nwhere she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way\\nout at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried\\nfor gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them\\nand told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men\\ndidn’t believe the wild tale at first, “because,” said they, “you are\\nfive miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”—then took\\nthem aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two\\nor three hours after dark and then brought them home.\\n\\nBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him\\nwere tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind\\nthem, and informed of the great news.\\n\\nThree days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to\\nbe shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were\\nbedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and\\nmore tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,\\nwas downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky\\ndid not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had\\npassed through a wasting illness.\\n\\nTom learned of Huck’s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could\\nnot be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.\\nHe was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his\\nadventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by\\nto see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;\\nalso that the “ragged man’s” body had eventually been found in the river\\nnear the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,\\nperhaps.\\n\\nAbout a fortnight after Tom’s rescue from the cave, he started off to\\nvisit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting\\ntalk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge\\nThatcher’s house was on Tom’s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The\\nJudge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him\\nironically if he wouldn’t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he\\nthought he wouldn’t mind it. The Judge said:\\n\\n“Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I’ve not the least doubt.\\nBut we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any\\nmore.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and\\ntriple-locked—and I’ve got the keys.”\\n\\nTom turned as white as a sheet.\\n\\n“What’s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!”\\n\\nThe water was brought and thrown into Tom’s face.\\n\\n“Ah, now you’re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?”\\n\\n“Oh, Judge, Injun Joe’s in the cave!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\n\\n\\nWithin a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of\\nmen were on their way to McDougal’s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled\\nwith passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore\\nJudge Thatcher.\\n\\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in\\nthe dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,\\ndead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing\\neyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer\\nof the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own\\nexperience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but\\nnevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,\\nwhich revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated\\nbefore how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day\\nhe lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\\n\\nInjun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great\\nfoundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with\\ntedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a\\nsill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought\\nno effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there\\nhad been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless\\nstill, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have\\nsqueezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked\\nthat place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary\\ntime—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could\\nfind half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this\\nvestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner\\nhad searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a\\nfew bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The\\npoor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a\\nstalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded\\nby the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off\\nthe stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had\\nscooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once\\nin every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a\\ndessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling\\nwhen the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome\\nwere laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the\\nBritish empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was\\n“news.”\\n\\nIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall\\nhave sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,\\nand been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a\\npurpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand\\nyears to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it\\nanother important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No\\nmatter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped\\nout the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist\\nstares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when\\nhe comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands\\nfirst in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace”\\n cannot rival it.\\n\\nInjun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked\\nthere in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and\\nhamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and\\nall sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as\\nsatisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the\\nhanging.\\n\\nThis funeral stopped the further growth of one thing—the petition to the\\ngovernor for Injun Joe’s pardon. The petition had been largely signed;\\nmany tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of\\nsappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the\\ngovernor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty\\nunder foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the\\nvillage, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would\\nhave been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a\\npardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired\\nand leaky water-works.\\n\\nThe morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have\\nan important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom’s adventure from the\\nWelshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned\\nthere was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted\\nto talk about now. Huck’s face saddened. He said:\\n\\n“I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but\\nwhiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must ’a’ ben\\nyou, soon as I heard ’bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you\\nhadn’t got the money becuz you’d ’a’ got at me some way or other and\\ntold me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always\\ntold me we’d never get holt of that swag.”\\n\\n“Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern\\nwas all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don’t you remember you\\nwas to watch there that night?”\\n\\n“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a year ago. It was that very night that I\\nfollered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”\\n\\n“_You_ followed him?”\\n\\n“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and\\nI don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t\\nben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”\\n\\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only\\nheard of the Welshman’s part of it before.\\n\\n“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever\\nnipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways\\nit’s a goner for us, Tom.”\\n\\n“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”\\n\\n“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on\\nthe track of that money again?”\\n\\n“Huck, it’s in the cave!”\\n\\nHuck’s eyes blazed.\\n\\n“Say it again, Tom.”\\n\\n“The money’s in the cave!”\\n\\n“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”\\n\\n“Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in\\nthere with me and help get it out?”\\n\\n“I bet I will! I will if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not\\nget lost.”\\n\\n“Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the\\nworld.”\\n\\n“Good as wheat! What makes you think the money’s—”\\n\\n“Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don’t find it I’ll\\nagree to give you my drum and every thing I’ve got in the world. I will,\\nby jings.”\\n\\n“All right—it’s a whiz. When do you say?”\\n\\n“Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?”\\n\\n“Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,\\nnow, but I can’t walk more’n a mile, Tom—least I don’t think I could.”\\n\\n“It’s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,\\nbut there’s a mighty short cut that they don’t anybody but me know\\nabout. Huck, I’ll take you right to it in a skiff. I’ll float the skiff\\ndown there, and I’ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn’t ever\\nturn your hand over.”\\n\\n“Less start right off, Tom.”\\n\\n“All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little\\nbag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled\\nthings they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many’s the time I wished I\\nhad some when I was in there before.”\\n\\nA trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who\\nwas absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles\\nbelow “Cave Hollow,” Tom said:\\n\\n“Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the\\ncave hollow—no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see\\nthat white place up yonder where there’s been a landslide? Well, that’s\\none of my marks. We’ll get ashore, now.”\\n\\nThey landed.\\n\\n“Now, Huck, where we’re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out\\nof with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.”\\n\\nHuck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly\\nmarched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:\\n\\n“Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it’s the snuggest hole in this country.\\nYou just keep mum about it. All along I’ve been wanting to be a robber,\\nbut I knew I’d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across\\nit was the bother. We’ve got it now, and we’ll keep it quiet, only we’ll\\nlet Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because of course there’s got to be a\\nGang, or else there wouldn’t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it\\nsounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”\\n\\n“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”\\n\\n“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that’s mostly the way.”\\n\\n“And kill them?”\\n\\n“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”\\n\\n“What’s a ransom?”\\n\\n“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after\\nyou’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s\\nthe general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women,\\nbut you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully\\nscared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat\\noff and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see\\nthat in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve\\nbeen in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that\\nyou couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right\\naround and come back. It’s so in all the books.”\\n\\n“Why, it’s real bully, Tom. I believe it’s better’n to be a pirate.”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s better in some ways, because it’s close to home and circuses\\nand all that.”\\n\\nBy this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in\\nthe lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then\\nmade their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought\\nthem to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.\\nHe showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay\\nagainst the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame\\nstruggle and expire.\\n\\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and\\ngloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently\\nentered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the\\n“jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not\\nreally a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet\\nhigh. Tom whispered:\\n\\n“Now I’ll show you something, Huck.”\\n\\nHe held his candle aloft and said:\\n\\n“Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There—on the\\nbig rock over yonder—done with candle-smoke.”\\n\\n“Tom, it’s a _cross_!”\\n\\n“_Now_ where’s your Number Two? ‘_under the cross_,’ hey? Right yonder’s\\nwhere I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!”\\n\\nHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:\\n\\n“Tom, less git out of here!”\\n\\n“What! and leave the treasure?”\\n\\n“Yes—leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost is round about there, certain.”\\n\\n“No it ain’t, Huck, no it ain’t. It would ha’nt the place where he\\ndied—away out at the mouth of the cave—five mile from here.”\\n\\n“No, Tom, it wouldn’t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of\\nghosts, and so do you.”\\n\\nTom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind.\\nBut presently an idea occurred to him—\\n\\n“Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we’re making of ourselves! Injun Joe’s\\nghost ain’t a going to come around where there’s a cross!”\\n\\nThe point was well taken. It had its effect.\\n\\n“Tom, I didn’t think of that. But that’s so. It’s luck for us, that\\ncross is. I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”\\n\\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.\\nHuck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the\\ngreat rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.\\nThey found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with\\na pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some\\nbacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there\\nwas no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in\\nvain. Tom said:\\n\\n“He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the\\ncross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the\\nground.”\\n\\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck\\ncould suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\\n\\n“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay\\nabout one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s\\nthat for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I’m going to dig in\\nthe clay.”\\n\\n“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.\\n\\nTom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches\\nbefore he struck wood.\\n\\n“Hey, Huck!—you hear that?”\\n\\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and\\nremoved. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.\\nTom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he\\ncould, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed\\nto explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended\\ngradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to\\nthe left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n“My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!”\\n\\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,\\nalong with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two\\nor three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish\\nwell soaked with the water-drip.\\n\\n“Got it at last!” said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with\\nhis hand. “My, but we’re rich, Tom!”\\n\\n“Huck, I always reckoned we’d get it. It’s just too good to believe, but\\nwe _have_ got it, sure! Say—let’s not fool around here. Let’s snake it\\nout. Lemme see if I can lift the box.”\\n\\nIt weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward\\nfashion, but could not carry it conveniently.\\n\\n“I thought so,” he said; “_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day\\nat the ha’nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of\\nfetching the little bags along.”\\n\\nThe money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross\\nrock.\\n\\n“Now less fetch the guns and things,” said Huck.\\n\\n“No, Huck—leave them there. They’re just the tricks to have when we\\ngo to robbing. We’ll keep them there all the time, and we’ll hold our\\norgies there, too. It’s an awful snug place for orgies.”\\n\\n“What orgies?”\\n\\n“I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we’ve got to\\nhave them, too. Come along, Huck, we’ve been in here a long time. It’s\\ngetting late, I reckon. I’m hungry, too. We’ll eat and smoke when we get\\nto the skiff.”\\n\\nThey presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily\\nout, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the\\nskiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got\\nunder way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting\\ncheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.\\n\\n“Now, Huck,” said Tom, “we’ll hide the money in the loft of the widow’s\\nwoodshed, and I’ll come up in the morning and we’ll count it and divide,\\nand then we’ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be\\nsafe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook\\nBenny Taylor’s little wagon; I won’t be gone a minute.”\\n\\nHe disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small\\nsacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,\\ndragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman’s\\nhouse, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the\\nWelshman stepped out and said:\\n\\n“Hallo, who’s that?”\\n\\n“Huck and Tom Sawyer.”\\n\\n“Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.\\nHere—hurry up, trot ahead—I’ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it’s not as\\nlight as it might be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?”\\n\\n“Old metal,” said Tom.\\n\\n“I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away\\nmore time hunting up six bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry\\nthan they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s\\nhuman nature—hurry along, hurry along!”\\n\\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\\n\\n“Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.”\\n\\nHuck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely\\naccused:\\n\\n“Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.”\\n\\nThe Welshman laughed.\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy. I don’t know about that. Ain’t you\\nand the widow good friends?”\\n\\n“Yes. Well, she’s ben good friends to me, anyway.”\\n\\n“All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?”\\n\\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck’s slow mind before he\\nfound himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room.\\nMr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.\\n\\nThe place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence\\nin the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the\\nRogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great\\nmany more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys\\nas heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They\\nwere covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson\\nwith humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered\\nhalf as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:\\n\\n“Tom wasn’t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and\\nHuck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”\\n\\n“And you did just right,” said the widow. “Come with me, boys.”\\n\\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:\\n\\n“Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of\\nclothes—shirts, socks, everything complete. They’re Huck’s—no, no\\nthanks, Huck—Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they’ll fit both\\nof you. Get into them. We’ll wait—come down when you are slicked up\\nenough.”\\n\\nThen she left.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\n\\n\\nHuck said: “Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain’t\\nhigh from the ground.”\\n\\n“Shucks! what do you want to slope for?”\\n\\n“Well, I ain’t used to that kind of a crowd. I can’t stand it. I ain’t\\ngoing down there, Tom.”\\n\\n“Oh, bother! It ain’t anything. I don’t mind it a bit. I’ll take care of\\nyou.”\\n\\nSid appeared.\\n\\n“Tom,” said he, “auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary\\ngot your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody’s been fretting about you.\\nSay—ain’t this grease and clay, on your clothes?”\\n\\n“Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist ’tend to your own business. What’s all this\\nblowout about, anyway?”\\n\\n“It’s one of the widow’s parties that she’s always having. This time\\nit’s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they\\nhelped her out of the other night. And say—I can tell you something, if\\nyou want to know.”\\n\\n“Well, what?”\\n\\n“Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people\\nhere tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a\\nsecret, but I reckon it’s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows—the\\nwidow, too, for all she tries to let on she don’t. Mr. Jones was bound\\nHuck should be here—couldn’t get along with his grand secret without\\nHuck, you know!”\\n\\n“Secret about what, Sid?”\\n\\n“About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow’s. I reckon Mr. Jones was\\ngoing to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop\\npretty flat.”\\n\\nSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\\n\\n“Sid, was it you that told?”\\n\\n“Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told—that’s enough.”\\n\\n“Sid, there’s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and\\nthat’s you. If you had been in Huck’s place you’d ’a’ sneaked down the\\nhill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can’t do any but mean\\nthings, and you can’t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.\\nThere—no thanks, as the widow says”—and Tom cuffed Sid’s ears and helped\\nhim to the door with several kicks. “Now go and tell auntie if you\\ndare—and tomorrow you’ll catch it!”\\n\\nSome minutes later the widow’s guests were at the supper-table, and a\\ndozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,\\nafter the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.\\nJones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the\\nhonor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was\\nanother person whose modesty—\\n\\nAnd so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck’s share in\\nthe adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the\\nsurprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and\\neffusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,\\nthe widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many\\ncompliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot\\nthe nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely\\nintolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody’s gaze\\nand everybody’s laudations.\\n\\nThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him\\neducated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in\\nbusiness in a modest way. Tom’s chance was come. He said:\\n\\n“Huck don’t need it. Huck’s rich.”\\n\\nNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept\\nback the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But\\nthe silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:\\n\\n“Huck’s got money. Maybe you don’t believe it, but he’s got lots of it.\\nOh, you needn’t smile—I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.”\\n\\nTom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed\\ninterest—and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.\\n\\n“Sid, what ails Tom?” said Aunt Polly. “He—well, there ain’t ever any\\nmaking of that boy out. I never—”\\n\\nTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly\\ndid not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the\\ntable and said:\\n\\n“There—what did I tell you? Half of it’s Huck’s and half of it’s mine!”\\n\\nThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for\\na moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said\\nhe could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of\\ninterest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the\\ncharm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:\\n\\n“I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it\\ndon’t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I’m\\nwilling to allow.”\\n\\nThe money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand\\ndollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time\\nbefore, though several persons were there who were worth considerably\\nmore than that in property.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\n\\n\\nThe reader may rest satisfied that Tom’s and Huck’s windfall made a\\nmighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a\\nsum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked\\nabout, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens\\ntottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every “haunted”\\nhouse in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,\\nplank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden\\ntreasure—and not by boys, but men—pretty grave, unromantic men, too,\\nsome of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,\\nstared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had\\npossessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and\\nrepeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as\\nremarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying\\ncommonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and\\ndiscovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper\\npublished biographical sketches of the boys.\\n\\nThe Widow Douglas put Huck’s money out at six per cent., and Judge\\nThatcher did the same with Tom’s at Aunt Polly’s request. Each lad had\\nan income, now, that was simply prodigious—a dollar for every weekday in\\nthe year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got—no,\\nit was what he was promised—he generally couldn’t collect it. A dollar\\nand a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old\\nsimple days—and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.\\n\\nJudge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no\\ncommonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When\\nBecky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her\\nwhipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded\\ngrace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that\\nwhipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine\\noutburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie—a lie that\\nwas worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to\\nbreast with George Washington’s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky\\nthought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he\\nwalked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight\\noff and told Tom about it.\\n\\nJudge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some\\nday. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the\\nNational Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school\\nin the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or\\nboth.\\n\\nHuck Finn’s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas’\\nprotection introduced him into society—no, dragged him into it, hurled\\nhim into it—and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The\\nwidow’s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they\\nbedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot\\nor stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had\\nto eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;\\nhe had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so\\nproperly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he\\nturned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him\\nhand and foot.\\n\\nHe bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up\\nmissing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in\\ngreat distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high\\nand low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning\\nTom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind\\nthe abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.\\nHuck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and\\nends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was\\nunkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made\\nhim picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him\\nout, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.\\nHuck’s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Don’t talk about it, Tom. I’ve tried it, and it don’t work; it don’t\\nwork, Tom. It ain’t for me; I ain’t used to it. The widder’s good to me,\\nand friendly; but I can’t stand them ways. She makes me get up just\\nat the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all\\nto thunder; she won’t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them\\nblamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don’t seem to any air\\ngit through ’em, somehow; and they’re so rotten nice that I can’t\\nset down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher’s; I hain’t slid on a\\ncellar-door for—well, it ’pears to be years; I got to go to church\\nand sweat and sweat—I hate them ornery sermons! I can’t ketch a fly in\\nthere, I can’t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by\\na bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell—everything’s so\\nawful reg’lar a body can’t stand it.”\\n\\n“Well, everybody does that way, Huck.”\\n\\n“Tom, it don’t make no difference. I ain’t everybody, and I can’t\\n_stand_ it. It’s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy—I don’t\\ntake no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;\\nI got to ask to go in a-swimming—dern’d if I hain’t got to ask to do\\neverything. Well, I’d got to talk so nice it wasn’t no comfort—I’d got\\nto go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste\\nin my mouth, or I’d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn’t let me smoke;\\nshe wouldn’t let me yell, she wouldn’t let me gape, nor stretch, nor\\nscratch, before folks—” [Then with a spasm of special irritation and\\ninjury]—“And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a\\nwoman! I _had_ to shove, Tom—I just had to. And besides, that school’s\\ngoing to open, and I’d a had to go to it—well, I wouldn’t stand _that_,\\nTom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain’t what it’s cracked up to be. It’s\\njust worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead\\nall the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar’l suits me, and\\nI ain’t ever going to shake ’em any more. Tom, I wouldn’t ever got into\\nall this trouble if it hadn’t ’a’ ben for that money; now you just take\\nmy sheer of it along with your’n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes—not\\nmany times, becuz I don’t give a dern for a thing ’thout it’s tollable\\nhard to git—and you go and beg off for me with the widder.”\\n\\n“Oh, Huck, you know I can’t do that. ’Tain’t fair; and besides if you’ll\\ntry this thing just a while longer you’ll come to like it.”\\n\\n“Like it! Yes—the way I’d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long\\nenough. No, Tom, I won’t be rich, and I won’t live in them cussed\\nsmothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and\\nI’ll stick to ’em, too. Blame it all! just as we’d got guns, and a cave,\\nand all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up\\nand spile it all!”\\n\\nTom saw his opportunity—\\n\\n“Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain’t going to keep me back from turning\\nrobber.”\\n\\n“No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?”\\n\\n“Just as dead earnest as I’m sitting here. But Huck, we can’t let you\\ninto the gang if you ain’t respectable, you know.”\\n\\nHuck’s joy was quenched.\\n\\n“Can’t let me in, Tom? Didn’t you let me go for a pirate?”\\n\\n“Yes, but that’s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a\\npirate is—as a general thing. In most countries they’re awful high up in\\nthe nobility—dukes and such.”\\n\\n“Now, Tom, hain’t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn’t shet me\\nout, would you, Tom? You wouldn’t do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?”\\n\\n“Huck, I wouldn’t want to, and I _don’t_ want to—but what would people\\nsay? Why, they’d say, ‘Mph! Tom Sawyer’s Gang! pretty low characters in\\nit!’ They’d mean you, Huck. You wouldn’t like that, and I wouldn’t.”\\n\\nHuck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Well, I’ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I\\ncan come to stand it, if you’ll let me b’long to the gang, Tom.”\\n\\n“All right, Huck, it’s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I’ll ask the\\nwidow to let up on you a little, Huck.”\\n\\n“Will you, Tom—now will you? That’s good. If she’ll let up on some of\\nthe roughest things, I’ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd\\nthrough or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?”\\n\\n“Oh, right off. We’ll get the boys together and have the initiation\\ntonight, maybe.”\\n\\n“Have the which?”\\n\\n“Have the initiation.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“It’s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang’s\\nsecrets, even if you’re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and\\nall his family that hurts one of the gang.”\\n\\n“That’s gay—that’s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.”\\n\\n“Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing’s got to be done at midnight,\\nin the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find—a ha’nted house is the\\nbest, but they’re all ripped up now.”\\n\\n“Well, midnight’s good, anyway, Tom.”\\n\\n“Yes, so it is. And you’ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with\\nblood.”\\n\\n“Now, that’s something _like_! Why, it’s a million times bullier than\\npirating. I’ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be\\na reg’lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking ’bout it, I reckon\\nshe’ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.”\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nSo endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it\\nmust stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the\\nhistory of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows\\nexactly where to stop—that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of\\njuveniles, he must stop where he best can.\\n\\nMost of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are\\nprosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the\\nstory of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they\\nturned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that\\npart of their lives at present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER, COMPLETE ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.

He has no patience with faith, an\\nintense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of\\nthings not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\\n\\nJohn is a physician, and perhaps—(I would not say it to a living soul,\\nof course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my\\nmind)—perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.\\n\\nYou see, he does not believe I am sick!\\n\\nAnd what can one do?\\n\\nIf a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends\\nand relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but\\ntemporary nervous depression—a slight hysterical tendency—what is one\\nto do?\\n\\nMy brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says\\nthe same thing.\\n\\nSo I take phosphates or phosphites—whichever it is, and tonics, and\\njourneys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to “work”\\nuntil I am well again.\\n\\nPersonally, I disagree with their ideas.\\n\\nPersonally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,\\nwould do me good.\\n\\nBut what is one to do?\\n\\nI did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good\\ndeal—having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\\n\\nI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and\\nmore society and stimulus—but John says the very worst thing I can do\\nis to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel\\nbad.\\n\\nSo I will let it alone and talk about the house.\\n\\nThe most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from\\nthe road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of\\nEnglish places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and\\ngates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners\\nand people.\\n\\nThere is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden—large and shady,\\nfull of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors\\nwith seats under them.\\n\\nThere were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\\n\\nThere was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and\\nco-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\\n\\nThat spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is\\nsomething strange about the house—I can feel it.\\n\\nI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt\\nwas a draught, and shut the window.\\n\\nI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to\\nbe so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\\n\\nBut John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\\ntake pains to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes me\\nvery tired.\\n\\nI don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\\npiazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\\nchintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\\n\\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no\\nnear room for him if he took another.\\n\\nHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\\ndirection.\\n\\nI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all\\ncare from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\\n\\nHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect\\nrest and all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your\\nstrength, my dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite;\\nbut air you can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the\\ntop of the house.\\n\\nIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look\\nall ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then\\nplayground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred\\nfor little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\\n\\nThe paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is\\nstripped off—the paper—in great patches all around the head of my bed,\\nabout as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of\\nthe room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\\n\\nOne of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic\\nsin.\\n\\nIt is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to\\nconstantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame,\\nuncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit\\nsuicide—plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in\\nunheard-of contradictions.\\n\\nThe color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean\\nyellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\\n\\nIt is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in\\nothers.\\n\\nNo wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to\\nlive in this room long.\\n\\nThere comes John, and I must put this away,—he hates to have me write a\\nword.\\n\\nWe have been here two weeks, and I haven’t felt like writing before,\\nsince that first day.\\n\\nI am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there\\nis nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of\\nstrength.\\n\\nJohn is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\\n\\nI am glad my case is not serious!\\n\\nBut these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\\n\\nJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no\\nreason to suffer, and that satisfies him.\\n\\nOf course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my\\nduty in any way!\\n\\nI meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and\\nhere I am a comparative burden already!\\n\\nNobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am\\nable—to dress and entertain, and order things.\\n\\nIt is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!\\n\\nAnd yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.\\n\\nI suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about\\nthis wallpaper!\\n\\nAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I\\nwas letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a\\nnervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\\n\\nHe said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy\\nbedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head\\nof the stairs, and so on.\\n\\n“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really, dear, I\\ndon’t care to renovate the house just for a three months’ rental.”\\n\\n“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, “there are such pretty rooms\\nthere.”\\n\\nThen he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and\\nsaid he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into\\nthe bargain.\\n\\nBut he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\\n\\nIt is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of\\ncourse, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a\\nwhim.\\n\\nI’m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid\\npaper.\\n\\nOut of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded\\narbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\\n\\nOut of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private\\nwharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that\\nruns down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in\\nthese numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give\\nway to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and\\nhabit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to\\nall manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good\\nsense to check the tendency. So I try.\\n\\nI think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it\\nwould relieve the press of ideas and rest me.\\n\\nBut I find I get pretty tired when I try.\\n\\nIt is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my\\nwork. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and\\nJulia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put\\nfire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people\\nabout now.\\n\\nI wish I could get well faster.\\n\\nBut I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew\\nwhat a vicious influence it had!\\n\\nThere is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck\\nand two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.\\n\\nI get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the\\neverlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,\\nunblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths\\ndidn’t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little\\nhigher than the other.\\n\\nI never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all\\nknow how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and\\nget more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain\\nfurniture than most children could find in a toy-store.\\n\\nI remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to\\nhave, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.\\n\\nI used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I\\ncould always hop into that chair and be safe.\\n\\nThe furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for\\nwe had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as\\na playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I\\nnever saw such ravages as the children have made here.\\n\\nThe wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh\\ncloser than a brother—they must have had perseverance as well as\\nhatred.\\n\\nThen the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster\\nitself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is\\nall we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\\n\\nBut I don’t mind it a bit—only the paper.\\n\\nThere comes John’s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful\\nof me! I must not let her find me writing.\\n\\nShe is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better\\nprofession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me\\nsick!\\n\\nBut I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these\\nwindows.\\n\\nThere is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road,\\nand one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too,\\nfull of great elms and velvet meadows.\\n\\nThis wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a\\nparticularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,\\nand not clearly then.\\n\\nBut in the places where it isn’t faded, and where the sun is just so, I\\ncan see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to\\nsulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\\n\\nThere’s sister on the stairs!\\n\\nWell, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired\\nout. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we\\njust had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.\\n\\nOf course I didn’t do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.\\n\\nBut it tired me all the same.\\n\\nJohn says if I don’t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell\\nin the fall.\\n\\nBut I don’t want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his\\nhands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more\\nso!\\n\\nBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\\n\\nI don’t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for\\nanything, and I’m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\\n\\nI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\\n\\nOf course I don’t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am\\nalone.\\n\\nAnd I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by\\nserious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\\n\\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\\nporch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\\n\\nI’m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps\\nbecause of the wallpaper.\\n\\nIt dwells in my mind so!\\n\\nI lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and\\nfollow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I\\nassure you. I start, we’ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over\\nthere where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth\\ntime that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a\\nconclusion.\\n\\nI know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was\\nnot arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition,\\nor symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.\\n\\nIt is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.\\n\\nLooked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and\\nflourishes—a kind of “debased Romanesque” with delirium tremens—go\\nwaddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.\\n\\nBut, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling\\noutlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of\\nwallowing seaweeds in full chase.\\n\\nThe whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I\\nexhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nThey have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds\\nwonderfully to the confusion.\\n\\nThere is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when\\nthe cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can\\nalmost fancy radiation after all,—the interminable grotesques seem to\\nform around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal\\ndistraction.\\n\\nIt makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap, I guess.\\n\\nI don’t know why I should write this.\\n\\nI don’t want to.\\n\\nI don’t feel able.\\n\\nAnd I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and\\nthink in some way—it is such a relief!\\n\\nBut the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.\\n\\nHalf the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.\\n\\nJohn says I mustn’t lose my strength, and has me take cod-liver oil and\\nlots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare\\nmeat.\\n\\nDear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried\\nto have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell\\nhim how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and\\nJulia.\\n\\nBut he said I wasn’t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got\\nthere; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was\\ncrying before I had finished.\\n\\nIt is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this\\nnervous weakness, I suppose.\\n\\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs\\nand laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my\\nhead.\\n\\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I\\nmust take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.\\n\\nHe says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my\\nwill and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.\\n\\nThere’s one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to\\noccupy this nursery with the horrid wallpaper.\\n\\nIf we had not used it that blessed child would have! What a fortunate\\nescape! Why, I wouldn’t have a child of mine, an impressionable little\\nthing, live in such a room for worlds.\\n\\nI never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here\\nafter all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.\\n\\nOf course I never mention it to them any more,—I am too wise,—but I\\nkeep watch of it all the same.\\n\\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\\n\\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\\n\\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\\n\\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\\npattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John\\nwould take me away from here!\\n\\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\\nand because he loves me so.\\n\\nBut I tried it last night.\\n\\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.\\n\\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\\none window or another.\\n\\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched\\nthe moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.\\n\\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she\\nwanted to get out.\\n\\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and\\nwhen I came back John was awake.\\n\\n“What is it, little girl?” he said. “Don’t go walking about like\\nthat—you’ll get cold.”\\n\\nI thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was\\nnot gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\\n\\n“Why darling!” said he, “our lease will be up in three weeks, and I\\ncan’t see how to leave before.\\n\\n“The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town\\njust now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but\\nyou really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a\\ndoctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your\\nappetite is better. I feel really much easier about you.”\\n\\n“I don’t weigh a bit more,” said I, “nor as much; and my appetite may\\nbe better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the\\nmorning when you are away.”\\n\\n“Bless her little heart!” said he with a big hug; “she shall be as sick\\nas she pleases! But now let’s improve the shining hours by going to\\nsleep, and talk about it in the morning!”\\n\\n“And you won’t go away?” I asked gloomily.\\n\\n“Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will\\ntake a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house\\nready. Really, dear, you are better!”\\n\\n“Better in body perhaps”—I began, and stopped short, for he sat up\\nstraight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I\\ncould not say another word.\\n\\n“My darling,” said he, “I beg of you, for my sake and for our child’s\\nsake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let\\nthat idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so\\nfascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish\\nfancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?”\\n\\nSo of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before\\nlong. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn’t,—I lay there for\\nhours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern\\nreally did move together or separately.\\n\\nOn a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a\\ndefiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.\\n\\nThe color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating\\nenough, but the pattern is torturing.\\n\\nYou think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in\\nfollowing, it turns a back somersault and there you are. It slaps you\\nin the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad\\ndream.\\n\\nThe outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.\\nIf you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of\\ntoadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,—why, that is\\nsomething like it.\\n\\nThat is, sometimes!\\n\\nThere is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems\\nto notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.\\n\\nWhen the sun shoots in through the east window—I always watch for that\\nfirst long, straight ray—it changes so quickly that I never can quite\\nbelieve it.\\n\\nThat is why I watch it always.\\n\\nBy moonlight—the moon shines in all night when there is a moon—I\\nwouldn’t know it was the same paper.\\n\\nAt night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and\\nworst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean,\\nand the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\\n\\nI didn’t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed\\nbehind,—that dim sub-pattern,—but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\\n\\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps\\nher so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.\\n\\nI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep\\nall I can.\\n\\nIndeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after\\neach meal.\\n\\nIt is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don’t sleep.\\n\\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don’t tell them I’m awake,—oh, no!\\n\\nThe fact is, I am getting a little afraid of John.\\n\\nHe seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable\\nlook.\\n\\nIt strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that\\nperhaps it is the paper!\\n\\nI have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into\\nthe room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I’ve caught him\\nseveral times looking at the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie\\nwith her hand on it once.\\n\\nShe didn’t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a\\nvery quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she\\nwas doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught\\nstealing, and looked quite angry—asked me why I should frighten her so!\\n\\nThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she\\nhad found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John’s, and she wished\\nwe would be more careful!\\n\\nDid not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern,\\nand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\\n\\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\\nsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\\nbetter, and am more quiet than I was.\\n\\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other\\nday, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.\\n\\nI turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was\\nbecause of the wallpaper—he would make fun of me. He might even want to\\ntake me away.\\n\\nI don’t want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week\\nmore, and I think that will be enough.\\n\\nI’m feeling ever so much better! I don’t sleep much at night, for it is\\nso interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the\\ndaytime.\\n\\nIn the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\\n\\nThere are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all\\nover it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried\\nconscientiously.\\n\\nIt is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all\\nthe yellow things I ever saw—not beautiful ones like buttercups, but\\nold foul, bad yellow things.\\n\\nBut there is something else about that paper—the smell! I noticed it\\nthe moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was\\nnot bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the\\nwindows are open or not, the smell is here.\\n\\nIt creeps all over the house.\\n\\nI find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding\\nin the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\\n\\nIt gets into my hair.\\n\\nEven when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise\\nit—there is that smell!\\n\\nSuch a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it,\\nto find what it smelled like.\\n\\nIt is not bad—at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most\\nenduring odor I ever met.\\n\\nIn this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it\\nhanging over me.\\n\\nIt used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\\nhouse—to reach the smell.\\n\\nBut now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like\\nis the color of the paper! A yellow smell.\\n\\nThere is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A\\nstreak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of\\nfurniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had\\nbeen rubbed over and over.\\n\\nI wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for.\\nRound and round and round—round and round and round—it makes me dizzy!\\n\\nI really have discovered something at last.\\n\\nThrough watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally\\nfound out.\\n\\nThe front pattern does move—and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!\\n\\nSometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes\\nonly one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all\\nover.\\n\\nThen in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady\\nspots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\\n\\nAnd she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb\\nthrough that pattern—it strangles so; I think that is why it has so\\nmany heads.\\n\\nThey get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns\\nthem upside-down, and makes their eyes white!\\n\\nIf those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\\n\\nI think that woman gets out in the daytime!\\n\\nAnd I’ll tell you why—privately—I’ve seen her!\\n\\nI can see her out of every one of my windows!\\n\\nIt is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most\\nwomen do not creep by daylight.\\n\\nI see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in\\nthose dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.\\n\\nI see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a\\ncarriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\\n\\nI don’t blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught\\ncreeping by daylight!\\n\\nI always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can’t do it at\\nnight, for I know John would suspect something at once.\\n\\nAnd John is so queer now, that I don’t want to irritate him. I wish he\\nwould take another room! Besides, I don’t want anybody to get that\\nwoman out at night but myself.\\n\\nI often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\\n\\nBut, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\\n\\nAnd though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can\\nturn!\\n\\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\\nfast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\\n\\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\\nto try it, little by little.\\n\\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\\nIt does not do to trust people too much.\\n\\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\\nis beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\\n\\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\\nShe had a very good report to give.\\n\\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\\n\\nJohn knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!\\n\\nHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very\\nloving and kind.\\n\\nAs if I couldn’t see through him!\\n\\nStill, I don’t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three\\nmonths.\\n\\nIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly\\naffected by it.\\n\\nHurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town\\nover night, and won’t be out until this evening.\\n\\nJennie wanted to sleep with me—the sly thing! but I told her I should\\nundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\\n\\nThat was clever, for really I wasn’t alone a bit! As soon as it was\\nmoonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\\ngot up and ran to help her.\\n\\nI pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we\\nhad peeled off yards of that paper.\\n\\nA strip about as high as my head and half around the room.\\n\\nAnd then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me\\nI declared I would finish it to-day!\\n\\nWe go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again\\nto leave things as they were before.\\n\\nJennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I\\ndid it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.\\n\\nShe laughed and said she wouldn’t mind doing it herself, but I must not\\nget tired.\\n\\nHow she betrayed herself that time!\\n\\nBut I am here, and no person touches this paper but me—not alive!\\n\\nShe tried to get me out of the room—it was too patent! But I said it\\nwas so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down\\nagain and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner—I would\\ncall when I woke.\\n\\nSo now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,\\nand there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the\\ncanvas mattress we found on it.\\n\\nWe shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.\\n\\nI quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.\\n\\nHow those children did tear about here!\\n\\nThis bedstead is fairly gnawed!\\n\\nBut I must get to work.\\n\\nI have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\\n\\nI don’t want to go out, and I don’t want to have anybody come in, till\\nJohn comes.\\n\\nI want to astonish him.\\n\\nI’ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman\\ndoes get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\\n\\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\\n\\nThis bed will not move!\\n\\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\\nbit off a little piece at one corner—but it hurt my teeth.\\n\\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It\\nsticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\\nheads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\\nderision!\\n\\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\\ntry.\\n\\nBesides I wouldn’t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\\n\\nI don’t like to look out of the windows even—there are so many of those\\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\\n\\nI wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\\n\\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope—you don’t get me\\nout in the road there!\\n\\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\\nnight, and that is hard!\\n\\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\\nplease!\\n\\nI don’t want to go outside. I won’t, even if Jennie asks me to.\\n\\nFor outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green\\ninstead of yellow.\\n\\nBut here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits\\nin that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.\\n\\nWhy, there’s John at the door!\\n\\nIt is no use, young man, you can’t open it!\\n\\nHow he does call and pound!\\n\\nNow he’s crying for an axe.\\n\\nIt would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!\\n\\n“John dear!” said I in the gentlest voice, “the key is down by the\\nfront steps, under a plantain leaf!”\\n\\nThat silenced him for a few moments.\\n\\nThen he said—very quietly indeed, “Open the door, my darling!”\\n\\n“I can’t,” said I. “The key is down by the front door under a plantain\\nleaf!”\\n\\nAnd then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and\\nsaid it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course,\\nand came in. He stopped short by the door.\\n\\n“What is the matter?” he cried. “For God’s sake, what are you doing!”\\n\\nI kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\\n\\n“I’ve got out at last,” said I, “in spite of you and Jane! And I’ve\\npulled off most of the paper, so you can’t put me back!”\\n\\nNow why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my\\npath by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE YELLOW WALLPAPER ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations.

Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

There is no doubt whatever about that.\\nThe register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the\\nundertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge\\'s name\\nwas good upon \\'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old\\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\\n\\nMind! I don\\'t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\\nparticularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,\\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the\\ntrade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country\\'s done for. You\\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\\ndead as a door-nail.\\n\\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\\'t know how many years. Scrooge\\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\\nit with an undoubted bargain.\\n\\nThe mention of Marley\\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\\'s father died\\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\\'s Churchyard, for\\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\\'s weak mind.\\n\\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\\'s name. There it stood, years\\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\\nwas all the same to him.\\n\\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\\ndog-days, and didn\\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\\n\\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\\'t know where to have him. The\\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \\'came down\\'\\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\\n\\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \\'My\\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\\' No beggars\\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\\no\\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\\'s dogs appeared to\\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\\nsaid, \\'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\\'\\n\\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \\'nuts\\' to Scrooge.\\n\\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\\nand was brewing on a large scale.\\n\\nThe door of Scrooge\\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\\'s fire\\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\\'t\\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\\n\\n\\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\\nthe voice of Scrooge\\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\\n\\n\\'Bah!\\' said Scrooge. \\'Humbug!\\'\\n\\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\\nnephew of Scrooge\\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\\n\\n\\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\\' said Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'You don\\'t mean\\nthat, I am sure?\\'\\n\\n\\'I do,\\' said Scrooge. \\'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\\'re poor enough.\\'\\n\\n\\'Come, then,\\' returned the nephew gaily. \\'What right have you to be\\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\\'re rich enough.\\'\\n\\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\\n\\'Bah!\\' again; and followed it up with \\'Humbug!\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be cross, uncle!\\' said the nephew.\\n\\n\\'What else can I be,\\' returned the uncle, \\'when I live in such a world\\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\\'s\\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \\'em through a round dozen\\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\\' said\\nScrooge indignantly, \\'every idiot who goes about with \"Merry Christmas\"\\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\\'\\n\\n\\'Uncle!\\' pleaded the nephew.\\n\\n\\'Nephew!\\' returned the uncle sternly, \\'keep Christmas in your own way,\\nand let me keep it in mine.\\'\\n\\n\\'Keep it!\\' repeated Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'But you don\\'t keep it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Let me leave it alone, then,\\' said Scrooge. \\'Much good may it do you!\\nMuch good it has ever done you!\\'\\n\\n\\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\\nhave not profited, I dare say,\\' returned the nephew; \\'Christmas among\\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\\nbless it!\\'\\n\\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\\nlast frail spark for ever.\\n\\n\\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\\' said Scrooge, \\'and you\\'ll keep\\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\\'re quite a powerful\\nspeaker, sir,\\' he added, turning to his nephew. \\'I wonder you don\\'t go\\ninto Parliament.\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\\'\\n\\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\\nextremity first.\\n\\n\\'But why?\\' cried Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'Why?\\'\\n\\n\\'Why did you get married?\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Because I fell in love.\\'\\n\\n\\'Because you fell in love!\\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \\'Good\\nafternoon!\\'\\n\\n\\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\\nit as a reason for not coming now?\\'\\n\\n\\'Good afternoon,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\\nfriends?\\'\\n\\n\\'Good afternoon!\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\\nin homage to Christmas, and I\\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\\'\\n\\n\\'Good afternoon,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'And A Happy New Year!\\'\\n\\n\\'Good afternoon!\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\\nthem cordially.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s another fellow,\\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \\'my\\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\\nabout a merry Christmas. I\\'ll retire to Bedlam.\\'\\n\\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\\'s nephew out, had let two other people\\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\\'s office. They had books and papers in their\\nhands, and bowed to him.\\n\\n\\'Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe,\\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\\nto his list. \\'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\\nMarley?\\'\\n\\n\\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\\' Scrooge replied. \\'He died\\nseven years ago, this very night.\\'\\n\\n\\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\\npartner,\\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\\n\\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\\n\\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\\nword \\'liberality\\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\\ncredentials back.\\n\\n\\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\\' said the gentleman,\\ntaking up a pen, \\'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\\'\\n\\n\\'Are there no prisons?\\' asked Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Plenty of prisons,\\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\\n\\n\\'And the Union workhouses?\\' demanded Scrooge. \\'Are they still in\\noperation?\\'\\n\\n\\'They are. Still,\\' returned the gentleman, \\'I wish I could say they were\\nnot.\\'\\n\\n\\'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Both very busy, sir.\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,\\' said Scrooge. \\'I am very\\nglad to hear it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\\nor body to the multitude,\\' returned the gentleman, \\'a few of us are\\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\\nput you down for?\\'\\n\\n\\'Nothing!\\' Scrooge replied.\\n\\n\\'You wish to be anonymous?\\'\\n\\n\\'I wish to be left alone,\\' said Scrooge. \\'Since you ask me what I wish,\\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don\\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\\nand I can\\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\\nbadly off must go there.\\'\\n\\n\\'Many can\\'t go there; and many would rather die.\\'\\n\\n\\'If they would rather die,\\' said Scrooge, \\'they had better do it, and\\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\\'t know that.\\'\\n\\n\\'But you might know it,\\' observed the gentleman.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s not my business,\\' Scrooge returned. \\'It\\'s enough for a man to\\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\\'s.\\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\\'\\n\\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\\n\\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\\nas they passed. Poulterers\\' and grocers\\' trades became a splendid joke:\\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\\'s household\\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\\nstirred up to-morrow\\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\\n\\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\\'s nose with a touch of such\\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\\nstooped down at Scrooge\\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\\nbut, at the first sound of\\n\\n  \\'God bless you, merry gentleman,\\n  May nothing you dismay!\\'\\n\\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\\nfrost.\\n\\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\\n\\n\\'You\\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'If quite convenient, sir.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s not convenient,\\' said Scrooge, \\'and it\\'s not fair. If I was to\\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\\'d think yourself ill used, I\\'ll be bound?\\'\\n\\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\\n\\n\\'And yet,\\' said Scrooge, \\'you don\\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\\nday\\'s wages for no work.\\'\\n\\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\\nEve_]\\n\\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\\n\\n\\'A poor excuse for picking a man\\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\\nDecember!\\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \\'But I\\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\\nmorning.\\'\\n\\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\\'s-buff.\\n\\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\\nwith his banker\\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\\nthreshold.\\n\\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\\nlast mention of his seven-years\\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\\nMarley\\'s face.\\n\\nMarley\\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\\nits own expression.\\n\\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\\n\\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\\n\\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\\'s pigtail sticking out into the\\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \\'Pooh, pooh!\\' and closed\\nit with a bang.\\n\\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\\n\\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\\'s dip.\\n\\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\\nthe face to desire to do that.\\n\\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\\nthe wall_]\\n\\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\\n\\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract\\nthe least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace\\nwas an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all\\nround with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\\nThere were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh\\'s daughters, Queens of Sheba,\\nAngelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like\\nfeather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in\\nbutter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that\\nface of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet\\'s rod,\\nand swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at\\nfirst, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the\\ndisjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of\\nold Marley\\'s head on every one.\\n\\n\\'Humbug!\\' said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\\n\\nAfter several turns he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the\\nchair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that\\nhung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with\\na chamber in the highest storey of the building. It was with great\\nastonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he\\nlooked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the\\noutset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and\\nso did every bell in the house.\\n\\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an\\nhour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded\\nby a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a\\nheavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant\\'s cellar. Scrooge then\\nremembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\\ndragging chains.\\n\\nThe cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the\\nnoise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then\\ncoming straight towards his door.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s humbug still!\\' said Scrooge. \\'I won\\'t believe it.\\'\\n\\nHis colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through\\nthe heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming\\nin, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \\'I know him! Marley\\'s\\nGhost!\\' and fell again.\\n\\nThe same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\\ntights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\\npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\\ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like\\na tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,\\nkeys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His\\nbody was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking\\nthrough his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\\n\\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\\nnever believed it until now.\\n\\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through\\nand through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the\\nfolded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not\\nobserved before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his\\nsenses.\\n\\n\\'How now!\\' said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. \\'What do you want\\nwith me?\\'\\n\\n\\'Much!\\'--Marley\\'s voice; no doubt about it.\\n\\n\\'Who are you?\\'\\n\\n\\'Ask me who I _was_.\\'\\n\\n\\'Who _were_ you, then?\\' said Scrooge, raising his voice. \\'You\\'re\\nparticular, for a shade.\\' He was going to say \\'_to_ a shade,\\' but\\nsubstituted this, as more appropriate.\\n\\n\\'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\\'\\n\\n\\'Can you--can you sit down?\\' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\\n\\n\\'I can.\\'\\n\\n\\'Do it, then.\\'\\n\\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn\\'t know whether a ghost so\\ntransparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt\\nthat in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\\nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the\\nopposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\\n\\n\\'You don\\'t believe in me,\\' observed the Ghost.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own\\nsenses?\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Why do you doubt your senses?\\'\\n\\n\\'Because,\\' said Scrooge, \\'a little thing affects them. A slight disorder\\nof the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,\\na blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.\\nThere\\'s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\\'\\n\\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in\\nhis heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his\\nterror; for the spectre\\'s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\\n\\nTo sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,\\nwould play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\\nvery awful, too, in the spectre\\'s being provided with an infernal\\natmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\\nclearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\\nhair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour\\nfrom an oven.\\n\\n\\'You see this toothpick?\\' said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,\\nfor the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a\\nsecond, to divert the vision\\'s stony gaze from himself.\\n\\n\\'I do,\\' replied the Ghost.\\n\\n\\'You are not looking at it,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'But I see it,\\' said the Ghost, \\'notwithstanding.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well!\\' returned Scrooge, \\'I have but to swallow this, and be for the\\nrest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own\\ncreation. Humbug, I tell you: humbug!\\'\\n\\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such\\na dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,\\nto save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his\\nhorror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it\\nwere too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\\nbreast!\\n\\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\\n\\n\\'Mercy!\\' he said. \\'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\\'\\n\\n\\'Man of the worldly mind!\\' replied the Ghost, \\'do you believe in me or\\nnot?\\'\\n\\n\\'I do,\\' said Scrooge; \\'I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and\\nwhy do they come to me?\\'\\n\\n\\'It is required of every man,\\' the Ghost returned, \\'that the spirit\\nwithin him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and\\nwide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do\\nso after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is\\nme!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,\\nand turned to happiness!\\'\\n\\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its\\nshadowy hands.\\n\\n\\'You are fettered,\\' said Scrooge, trembling. \\'Tell me why?\\'\\n\\n\\'I wear the chain I forged in life,\\' replied the Ghost. \\'I made it link\\nby link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of\\nmy own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?\\'\\n\\nScrooge trembled more and more.\\n\\n\\'Or would you know,\\' pursued the Ghost, \\'the weight and length of the\\nstrong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this\\nseven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a\\nponderous chain!\\'\\n\\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\\nhimself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he\\ncould see nothing.\\n\\n\\'Jacob!\\' he said imploringly. \\'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak\\ncomfort to me, Jacob!\\'\\n\\n\\'I have none to give,\\' the Ghost replied. \\'It comes from other regions,\\nEbenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of\\nmen. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all\\npermitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.\\nMy spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me;--in life my\\nspirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;\\nand weary journeys lie before me!\\'\\n\\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his\\nhands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he\\ndid so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\\n\\n[Illustration: ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND]\\n\\n\\'You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\\' Scrooge observed in a\\nbusiness-like manner, though with humility and deference.\\n\\n\\'Slow!\\' the Ghost repeated.\\n\\n\\'Seven years dead,\\' mused Scrooge. \\'And travelling all the time?\\'\\n\\n\\'The whole time,\\' said the Ghost. \\'No rest, no peace. Incessant torture\\nof remorse.\\'\\n\\n\\'You travel fast?\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\'On the wings of the wind,\\' replied the Ghost.\\n\\n\\'You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,\\'\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so\\nhideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have\\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\\n\\n\\'Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,\\' cried the phantom, \\'not to know\\nthat ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth\\nmust pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\\nall developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in\\nits little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too\\nshort for its vast means of usefulness! Not to know that no space of\\nregret can make amends for one life\\'s opportunities misused! Yet such\\nwas I! Oh, such was I!\\'\\n\\n\\'But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,\\' faltered Scrooge,\\nwho now began to apply this to himself.\\n\\n\\'Business!\\' cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. \\'Mankind was my\\nbusiness. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,\\nforbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my\\ntrade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my\\nbusiness!\\'\\n\\nIt held up its chain at arm\\'s-length, as if that were the cause of all\\nits unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\\n\\n\\'At this time of the rolling year,\\' the spectre said, \\'I suffer most.\\nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,\\nand never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a\\npoor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have\\nconducted _me_?\\'\\n\\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this\\nrate, and began to quake exceedingly.\\n\\n\\'Hear me!\\' cried the Ghost. \\'My time is nearly gone.\\'\\n\\n\\'I will,\\' said Scrooge. \\'But don\\'t be hard upon me! Don\\'t be flowery,\\nJacob! Pray!\\'\\n\\n\\'How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may\\nnot tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.\\'\\n\\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the\\nperspiration from his brow.\\n\\n\\'That is no light part of my penance,\\' pursued the Ghost. \\'I am here\\nto-night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my\\nfate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\\'\\n\\n\\'You were always a good friend to me,\\' said Scrooge. \\'Thankee!\\'\\n\\n\\'You will be haunted,\\' resumed the Ghost, \\'by Three Spirits.\\'\\n\\nScrooge\\'s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost\\'s had done.\\n\\n\\'Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?\\' he demanded in a\\nfaltering voice.\\n\\n\\'It is.\\'\\n\\n\\'I--I think I\\'d rather not,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Without their visits,\\' said the Ghost, \\'you cannot hope to shun the\\npath I tread. Expect the first to-morrow when the bell tolls One.\\'\\n\\n\\'Couldn\\'t I take \\'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?\\' hinted\\nScrooge.\\n\\n\\'Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third, upon\\nthe next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.\\nLook to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember\\nwhat has passed between us!\\'\\n\\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the\\ntable, and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the\\nsmart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the\\nbandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural\\nvisitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over\\nand about its arm.\\n\\n[Illustration: _The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and\\nthither in restless haste and moaning as they went_]\\n\\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and, at every step it took, the\\nwindow raised itself a little, so that, when the spectre reached it, it\\nwas wide open. It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they\\nwere within two paces of each other, Marley\\'s Ghost held up its hand,\\nwarning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\\n\\nNot so much in obedience as in surprise and fear; for, on the raising of\\nthe hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent\\nsounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\\nself-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in\\nthe mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\\n\\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked\\nout.\\n\\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in\\nrestless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains\\nlike Marley\\'s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were\\nlinked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to\\nScrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in\\na white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who\\ncried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an\\ninfant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was\\nclearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and\\nhad lost the power for ever.\\n\\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he\\ncould not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and\\nthe night became as it had been when he walked home.\\n\\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had\\nentered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,\\nand the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \\'Humbug!\\' but stopped at\\nthe first syllable. And being, from the emotions he had undergone, or\\nthe fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the\\ndull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in\\nneed of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep\\nupon the instant.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nSTAVE TWO\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS\\n\\n\\nWhen Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could\\nscarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his\\nchamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret\\neyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.\\nSo he listened for the hour.\\n\\nTo his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and\\nfrom seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!\\nIt was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must\\nhave got into the works. Twelve!\\n\\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous\\nclock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.\\n\\n\\'Why, it isn\\'t possible,\\' said Scrooge, \\'that I can have slept through a\\nwhole day and far into another night. It isn\\'t possible that anything\\nhas happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!\\'\\n\\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his\\nway to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve\\nof his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very\\nlittle then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and\\nextremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and\\nfro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if\\nnight had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This\\nwas a great relief, because \\'Three days after sight of this First of\\nExchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,\\' and so forth, would\\nhave become a mere United States security if there were no days to count\\nby.\\n\\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over\\nand over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more\\nperplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he\\nthought.\\n\\nMarley\\'s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within\\nhimself, after mature inquiry that it was all a dream, his mind flew\\nback again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and\\npresented the same problem to be worked all through, \\'Was it a dream or\\nnot?\\'\\n\\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three-quarters more,\\nwhen he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a\\nvisitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the\\nhour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than\\ngo to heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in his power.\\n\\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must\\nhave sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it\\nbroke upon his listening ear.\\n\\n\\'Ding, dong!\\'\\n\\n\\'A quarter past,\\' said Scrooge, counting.\\n\\n\\'Ding, dong!\\'\\n\\n\\'Half past,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Ding, dong!\\'\\n\\n\\'A quarter to it.\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Ding, dong!\\'\\n\\n\\'The hour itself,\\' said Scrooge triumphantly, \\'and nothing else!\\'\\n\\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,\\ndull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the\\ninstant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\\n\\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not\\nthe curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to\\nwhich his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside;\\nand Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself\\nface to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as\\nI am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\\n\\nIt was a strange figure--like a child; yet not so like a child as like\\nan old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the\\nappearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a\\nchild\\'s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its\\nback, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\\nit, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and\\nmuscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.\\nIts legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper\\nmembers, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist\\nwas bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a\\nbranch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction\\nof that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But\\nthe strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there\\nsprang a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and\\nwhich was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\\ngreat extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\\n\\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness,\\nwas _not_ its strangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and\\nglittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was light one\\ninstant at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its\\ndistinctness; being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with\\ntwenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\\nbody: of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense\\ngloom wherein they melted away. And, in the very wonder of this, it\\nwould be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.\\n\\n\\'Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\\' asked\\nScrooge.\\n\\n\\'I am!\\'\\n\\nThe voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if, instead of being\\nso close behind him, it were at a distance.\\n\\n\\'Who and what are you?\\' Scrooge demanded.\\n\\n\\'I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\\'\\n\\n\\'Long Past?\\' inquired Scrooge, observant of its dwarfish stature.\\n\\n\\'No. Your past.\\'\\n\\nPerhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have\\nasked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap,\\nand begged him to be covered.\\n\\n\\'What!\\' exclaimed the Ghost, \\'would you so soon put out, with worldly\\nhands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those\\nwhose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years\\nto wear it low upon my brow?\\'\\n\\nScrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge\\nof having wilfully \\'bonneted\\' the Spirit at any period of his life. He\\nthen made bold to inquire what business brought him there.\\n\\n\\'Your welfare!\\' said the Ghost.\\n\\nScrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that\\na night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The\\nSpirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately--\\n\\n\\'Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\\'\\n\\nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the\\narm.\\n\\n\\'Rise! and walk with me!\\'\\n\\nIt would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the\\nhour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the\\nthermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in\\nhis slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon\\nhim at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman\\'s hand, was not\\nto be resisted. He rose; but, finding that the Spirit made towards the\\nwindow, clasped its robe in supplication.\\n\\n\\'I am a mortal,\\' Scrooge remonstrated, \\'and liable to fall.\\'\\n\\n\\'Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,\\' said the Spirit, laying it upon\\nhis heart, \\'and you shall be upheld in more than this!\\'\\n\\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon\\nan open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely\\nvanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist\\nhad vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow\\nupon the ground.\\n\\n\\'Good Heaven!\\' said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked\\nabout him. \\'I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!\\'\\n\\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been\\nlight and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man\\'s sense\\nof feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air,\\neach one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and\\ncares long, long forgotten!\\n\\n\\'Your lip is trembling,\\' said the Ghost. \\'And what is that upon your\\ncheek?\\'\\n\\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a\\npimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\\n\\n\\'You recollect the way?\\' inquired the Spirit.\\n\\n\\'Remember it!\\' cried Scrooge with fervour; \\'I could walk it blindfold.\\'\\n\\n\\'Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\\' observed the Ghost.\\n\\'Let us go on.\\'\\n\\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post,\\nand tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its\\nbridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen\\ntrotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other\\nboys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were\\nin great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were\\nso full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.\\n\\n\\'These are but shadows of the things that have been,\\' said the Ghost.\\n\\'They have no consciousness of us.\\'\\n\\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named\\nthem every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why\\ndid his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why\\nwas he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several\\nhomes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!\\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\\n\\n\\'The school is not quite deserted,\\' said the Ghost. \\'A solitary child,\\nneglected by his friends, is left there still.\\'\\n\\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\\n\\nThey left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a\\nmansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola\\non the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\\nbroken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and\\nsheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\\nstate within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\\nvast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\\ncandle light and not too much to eat.\\n\\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\\nof the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\\nhe had used to be.\\n\\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\\nbehind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the\\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\\npoplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a\\nclicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening\\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\\n\\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully\\nreal and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe\\nstuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\\n\\n\\'Why, it\\'s Ali Baba!\\' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \\'It\\'s dear old\\nhonest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder\\nsolitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\\ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,\\' said Scrooge, \\'and his\\nwild brother, Orson; there they go! And what\\'s his name, who was put\\ndown in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don\\'t you see him?\\nAnd the Sultan\\'s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon\\nhis head! Serve him right! I\\'m glad of it. What business had he to be\\nmarried to the Princess?\\'\\n\\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\\nto see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\\nhis business friends in the City, indeed.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s the Parrot!\\' cried Scrooge. \\'Green body and yellow tail, with a\\nthing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\\nPoor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing\\nround the island. \"Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\\nCrusoe?\" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn\\'t. It was the\\nParrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little\\ncreek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\\'\\n\\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,\\nhe said, in pity for his former self, \\'Poor boy!\\' and cried again.\\n\\n\\'I wish,\\' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking\\nabout him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; \\'but it\\'s too late now.\\'\\n\\n\\'What is the matter?\\' asked the Spirit.\\n\\n\\'Nothing,\\' said Scrooge. \\'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas\\ncarol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:\\nthat\\'s all.\\'\\n\\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\\n\\'Let us see another Christmas!\\'\\n\\nScrooge\\'s former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had\\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\\n\\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\\nanxiously towards the door.\\n\\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\\nin, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\\naddressed him as her \\'dear, dear brother.\\'\\n\\n\\'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\\' said the child, clapping\\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. \\'To bring you home, home,\\nhome!\\'\\n\\n\\'Home, little Fan?\\' returned the boy.\\n\\n\\'Yes!\\' said the child, brimful of glee. \\'Home for good and all. Home for\\never and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home\\'s\\nlike heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\\nbed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\\nand he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\\nyou\\'re to be a man!\\' said the child, opening her eyes; \\'and are never to\\ncome back here; but first we\\'re to be together all the Christmas long,\\nand have the merriest time in all the world.\\'\\n\\n\\'You are quite a woman, little Fan!\\' exclaimed the boy.\\n\\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\\nbeing too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then\\nshe began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and\\nhe, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\\n\\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, \\'Bring down Master Scrooge\\'s box,\\nthere!\\' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at\\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\\n\\'something\\' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\\nMaster Scrooge\\'s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\\nwheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\\nevergreens like spray.\\n\\n[Illustration: HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE, AND A\\nBLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE]\\n\\n\\'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,\\' said\\nthe Ghost. \\'But she had a large heart!\\'\\n\\n\\'So she had,\\' cried Scrooge. \\'You\\'re right. I will not gainsay it,\\nSpirit. God forbid!\\'\\n\\n\\'She died a woman,\\' said the Ghost, \\'and had, as I think, children.\\'\\n\\n\\'One child,\\' Scrooge returned.\\n\\n\\'True,\\' said the Ghost. \\'Your nephew!\\'\\n\\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, \\'Yes.\\'\\n\\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\\nand re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\\n\\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\\nknew it.\\n\\n\\'Know it!\\' said Scrooge. \\'Was I apprenticed here?\\'\\n\\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\\nexcitement--\\n\\n\\'Why, it\\'s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it\\'s Fezziwig alive again!\\'\\n\\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\\npointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his\\ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his\\norgan of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,\\njovial voice--\\n\\n\\'Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\\'\\n\\nScrooge\\'s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\\naccompanied by his fellow-\\'prentice.\\n\\n\\'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\\' said Scrooge to the Ghost. \\'Bless me, yes.\\nThere he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,\\ndear!\\'\\n\\n\\'Yo ho, my boys!\\' said Fezziwig. \\'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,\\nDick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let\\'s have the shutters up,\\' cried old\\nFezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, \\'before a man can say Jack\\nRobinson!\\'\\n\\nYou wouldn\\'t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into\\nthe street with the shutters--one, two, three--had \\'em up in their\\nplaces--four, five, six--barred \\'em and pinned \\'em--seven, eight,\\nnine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like\\nracehorses.\\n\\n\\'Hilli-ho!\\' cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with\\nwonderful agility. \\'Clear away, my lads, and let\\'s have lots of room\\nhere! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!\\'\\n\\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn\\'t have cleared away, or\\ncouldn\\'t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in\\na minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from\\npublic life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps\\nwere trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as\\nsnug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to\\nsee upon a winter\\'s night.\\n\\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\\nmade an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came\\nMrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss\\nFezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose\\nhearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the\\nbusiness. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the\\ncook with her brother\\'s particular friend the milkman. In came the boy\\nfrom over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his\\nmaster; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one,\\nwho was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all\\ncame, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some\\nawkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and\\nevery how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round\\nand back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and\\nround in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always\\nturning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon\\nas they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help\\nthem! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\\nhands to stop the dance, cried out, \\'Well done!\\' and the fiddler plunged\\nhis hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.\\nBut, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again,\\nthough there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been\\ncarried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\\nresolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs.\\nFezziwig_]\\n\\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and\\nthere was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold\\nRoast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were\\nmince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came\\nafter the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The\\nsort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told\\nit him!) struck up \\'Sir Roger de Coverley.\\' Then old Fezziwig stood\\nout to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff\\npiece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of\\npartners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would\\ndance, and had no notion of walking.\\n\\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fezziwig would\\nhave been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_, she\\nwas worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that\\'s not\\nhigh praise, tell me higher, and I\\'ll use it. A positive light appeared\\nto issue from Fezziwig\\'s calves. They shone in every part of the dance\\nlike moons. You couldn\\'t have predicted, at any given time, what would\\nbecome of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone\\nall through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner,\\nbow and curtsy, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and back again to your\\nplace: Fezziwig \\'cut\\'--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his\\nlegs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.\\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking\\nhands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him\\nor her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two\\n\\'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died\\naway, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter\\nin the back-shop.\\n\\nDuring the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He\\ncorroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and\\nunderwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright\\nfaces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon\\nhim, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\\n\\n\\'A small matter,\\' said the Ghost, \\'to make these silly folks so full of\\ngratitude.\\'\\n\\n\\'Small!\\' echoed Scrooge.\\n\\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so,\\nsaid:\\n\\n\\'Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:\\nthree or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?\\'\\n\\n\\'It isn\\'t that,\\' said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking\\nunconsciously like his former, not his latter self. \\'It isn\\'t that,\\nSpirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our\\nservice light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power\\nlies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it\\nis impossible to add and count \\'em up: what then? The happiness he gives\\nis quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\\'\\n\\nHe felt the Spirit\\'s glance, and stopped.\\n\\n\\'What is the matter?\\' asked the Ghost.\\n\\n\\'Nothing particular,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Something, I think?\\' the Ghost insisted.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' said Scrooge, \\'no. I should like to be able to say a word or two\\nto my clerk just now. That\\'s all.\\'\\n\\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\\n\\n\\'My time grows short,\\' observed the Spirit. \\'Quick!\\'\\n\\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\\nrigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\\nthe growing tree would fall.\\n\\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning\\ndress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that\\nshone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\\n\\n\\'It matters little,\\' she said softly. \\'To you, very little. Another idol\\nhas displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come\\nas I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.\\'\\n\\n\\'What Idol has displaced you?\\' he rejoined.\\n\\n\\'A golden one.\\'\\n\\n\\'This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\\' he said. \\'There is\\nnothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it\\nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!\\'\\n\\n\\'You fear the world too much,\\' she answered gently. \\'All your other\\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\\nreproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\\'\\n\\n\\'What then?\\' he retorted. \\'Even if I have grown so much wiser, what\\nthen? I am not changed towards you.\\'\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n\\'Am I?\\'\\n\\n\\'Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor, and\\ncontent to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly\\nfortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made you\\nwere another man.\\'\\n\\n\\'I was a boy,\\' he said impatiently.\\n\\n\\'Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,\\' she\\nreturned. \\'I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart\\nis fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I\\nhave thought of this I will not say. It is enough that I _have_ thought\\nof it, and can release you.\\'\\n\\n\\'Have I ever sought release?\\'\\n\\n\\'In words. No. Never.\\'\\n\\n\\'In what, then?\\'\\n\\n\\'In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of\\nlife; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of\\nany worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,\\'\\nsaid the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; \\'tell me,\\nwould you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!\\'\\n\\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of\\nhimself. But he said, with a struggle, \\'You think not.\\'\\n\\n\\'I would gladly think otherwise if I could,\\' she answered. \\'Heaven\\nknows! When _I_ have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and\\nirresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow,\\nyesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless\\ngirl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by\\nGain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\\none guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and\\nregret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart,\\nfor the love of him you once were.\\'\\n\\n[Illustration: SHE LEFT HIM, AND THEY PARTED]\\n\\nHe was about to speak; but, with her head turned from him, she resumed:\\n\\n\\'You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have\\npain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the\\nrecollection of it gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it\\nhappened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have\\nchosen!\\'\\n\\nShe left him, and they parted.\\n\\n\\'Spirit!\\' said Scrooge, \\'show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you\\ndelight to torture me?\\'\\n\\n\\'One shadow more!\\' exclaimed the Ghost.\\n\\n\\'No more!\\' cried Scrooge. \\'No more! I don\\'t wish to see it. Show me no\\nmore!\\'\\n\\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\\nto observe what happened next.\\n\\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty\\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I\\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn\\'t for the wealth of all\\nthe world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the\\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn\\'t have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\\nto save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold\\nyoung brood, I couldn\\'t have done it; I should have expected my arm to\\nhave grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And\\nyet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the\\nlashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose\\nwaves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in\\nshort, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\\nlicense of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\\n\\n[Illustration: _A flushed and boisterous group_]\\n\\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately\\nensued that she, with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne\\ntowards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to\\ngreet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas\\ntoys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the\\nonslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with\\nchairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his\\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\\nthe act of putting a doll\\'s frying pan into his mouth, and was more than\\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough\\nthat, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the\\nparlour, and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where\\nthey went to bed, and so subsided.\\n\\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\\n\\n\\'Belle,\\' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, \\'I saw an\\nold friend of yours this afternoon.\\'\\n\\n\\'Who was it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Guess!\\'\\n\\n\\'How can I? Tut, don\\'t I know?\\' she added in the same breath, laughing\\nas he laughed. \\'Mr. Scrooge.\\'\\n\\n\\'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut\\nup, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.\\'\\n\\n\\'Spirit!\\' said Scrooge in a broken voice, \\'remove me from this place.\\'\\n\\n\\'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,\\' said the\\nGhost. \\'That they are what they are do not blame me!\\'\\n\\n\\'Remove me!\\' Scrooge exclaimed, \\'I cannot bear it!\\'\\n\\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\\n\\n\\'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!\\'\\n\\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\\nhead.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Laden with Christmas toys and presents_]\\n\\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\\nflood upon the ground.\\n\\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\nSTAVE THREE\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS\\n\\n\\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in\\nbed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told\\nthat the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was\\nrestored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial\\npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to\\nhim through Jacob Marley\\'s intervention. But finding that he turned\\nuncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this\\nnew spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own\\nhands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the\\nbed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.\\n\\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of\\nday, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing\\nthat they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;\\nbetween which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide\\nand comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite\\nas hardily as this, I don\\'t mind calling on you to believe that he was\\nready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing\\nbetween a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\\n\\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\\nprepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no\\nshape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\\nAll this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you\\nor I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the\\npredicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\\nunquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that\\nthe source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining\\nroom, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea\\ntaking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in\\nhis slippers to the door.\\n\\nThe moment Scrooge\\'s hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by\\nhis name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\\n\\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which\\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as\\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge\\'s time,\\nor Marley\\'s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the\\nfloor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\\nbrawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a\\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\\nunlike Plenty\\'s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on\\nScrooge as he came peeping round the door.\\n\\n\\'Come in!\\' exclaimed the Ghost. \\'Come in! and know me better, man!\\'\\n\\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit\\'s eyes were\\nclear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\\n\\n\\'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,\\' said the Spirit. \\'Look upon me!\\'\\n\\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,\\nor mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\\nicicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\\nan antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\\neaten up with rust.\\n\\n\\'You have never seen the like of me before!\\' exclaimed the Spirit.\\n\\n\\'Never,\\' Scrooge made answer to it.\\n\\n\\'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning\\n(for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?\\'\\npursued the Phantom.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t think I have,\\' said Scrooge. \\'I am afraid I have not. Have you\\nhad many brothers, Spirit?\\'\\n\\n\\'More than eighteen hundred,\\' said the Ghost.\\n\\n\\'A tremendous family to provide for,\\' muttered Scrooge.\\n\\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\\n\\n\\'Spirit,\\' said Scrooge submissively, \\'conduct me where you will. I went\\nforth last night on compulsion, and I learned a lesson which is working\\nnow. To-night if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Touch my robe!\\'\\n\\nScrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\\n\\nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\\nbrawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch,\\nall vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the\\nhour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning,\\nwhere (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk\\nand not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement\\nin front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence\\nit was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the\\nroad below, and splitting into artificial little snowstorms.\\n\\nThe house-fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker,\\ncontrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with\\nthe dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed\\nup in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons: furrows\\nthat crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great\\nstreets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the\\nthick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest\\nstreets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen,\\nwhose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all\\nthe chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were\\nblazing away to their dear heart\\'s content. There was nothing very\\ncheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\\ncheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer\\nsun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\\n\\n[Illustration: THERE WAS NOTHING VERY CHEERFUL IN THE CLIMATE]\\n\\nFor the people who were shovelling away on the house-tops were jovial\\nand full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now\\nand then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far\\nthan many a wordy jest--laughing heartily if it went right, and not less\\nheartily if it went wrong. The poulterers\\' shops were still half open,\\nand the fruiterers\\' were radiant in their glory. There were great,\\nround, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of\\njolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the\\nstreet in their apoplectic opulence: There were ruddy, brown-faced,\\nbroad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their growth\\nlike Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at\\nthe girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up\\nmistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming\\npyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers\\'\\nbenevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people\\'s mouths might\\nwater gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and\\nbrown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and\\npleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were\\nNorfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the\\noranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy\\npersons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper\\nbags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth\\namong these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\\nstagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going\\non; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in\\nslow and passionless excitement.\\n\\nThe Grocers\\'! oh, the Grocers\\'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters\\ndown, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone\\nthat the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that\\nthe twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters\\nwere rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\\nscents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the\\nraisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the\\nsticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious,\\nthe candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the\\ncoldest lookers-on feel faint, and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that\\nthe figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\\nmodest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything\\nwas good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all\\nso hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they\\ntumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets\\nwildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running\\nback to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the\\nbest humour possible; while the grocer and his people were so frank and\\nfresh, that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons\\nbehind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection,\\nand for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\\n\\nBut soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel, and\\naway they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes and\\nwith their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged, from scores\\nof by-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people,\\ncarrying their dinners to the bakers\\' shops. The sight of these poor\\nrevellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\\nScrooge beside him in a baker\\'s doorway, and, taking off the covers as\\ntheir bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.\\nAnd it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice, when there\\nwere angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each\\nother, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their\\ngood-humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to\\nquarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\\n\\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was\\na genial shadowing forth of all these dinners, and the progress of their\\ncooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker\\'s oven, where the\\npavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\\n\\n\\'Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?\\'\\nasked Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'There is. My own.\\'\\n\\n\\'Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\\' asked Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why to a poor one most?\\' asked Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Because it needs it most.\\'\\n\\n\\'Spirit!\\' said Scrooge, after a moment\\'s thought, \\'I wonder you, of all\\nthe beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these\\npeople\\'s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.\\n\\n\\'I!\\' cried the Spirit.\\n\\n\\'You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day,\\noften the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,\\' said\\nScrooge; \\'wouldn\\'t you?\\'\\n\\n\\'I!\\' cried the Spirit.\\n\\n\\'You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day,\\' said Scrooge. \\'And\\nit comes to the same thing.\\'\\n\\n\\'I seek!\\' exclaimed the Spirit.\\n\\n\\'Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in\\nthat of your family,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'There are some upon this earth of yours,\\' returned the Spirit, \\'who\\nlay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride,\\nill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as\\nstrange to us, and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived.\\nRemember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.\\'\\n\\nScrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had\\nbeen before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality\\nof the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker\\'s), that\\nnotwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any\\nplace with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\\ngracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could\\nhave done in any lofty hall.\\n\\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this\\npower of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and\\nhis sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge\\'s\\nclerk\\'s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his\\nrobe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to\\nbless Bob Cratchit\\'s dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch. Think\\nof that! Bob had but fifteen \\'Bob\\' a week himself; he pocketed on\\nSaturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of\\nChristmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\\n\\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit\\'s wife, dressed out but poorly in a\\ntwice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a\\ngoodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda\\nCratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master\\nPeter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting\\nthe corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob\\'s private property,\\nconferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,\\nrejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his\\nlinen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and\\ngirl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker\\'s they had smelt\\nthe goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts\\nof sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and\\nexalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,\\nalthough his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow\\npotatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out\\nand peeled.\\n\\n\\'What has ever got your precious father, then?\\' said Mrs. Cratchit. \\'And\\nyour brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn\\'t as late last Christmas Day by\\nhalf an hour!\\'\\n\\n\\'Here\\'s Martha, mother!\\' said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\\n\\n\\'Here\\'s Martha, mother!\\' cried the two young Cratchits. \\'Hurrah! There\\'s\\n_such_ a goose, Martha!\\'\\n\\n\\'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\\' said Mrs.\\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet\\nfor her with officious zeal.\\n\\n\\'We\\'d a deal of work to finish up last night,\\' replied the girl, \\'and\\nhad to clear away this morning, mother!\\'\\n\\n\\'Well! never mind so long as you are come,\\' said Mrs. Cratchit. \\'Sit ye\\ndown before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!\\'\\n\\n\\'No, no! There\\'s father coming,\\' cried the two young Cratchits, who were\\neverywhere at once. \\'Hide, Martha, hide!\\'\\n\\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least\\nthree feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before\\nhim, and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look\\nseasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a\\nlittle crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\\n\\n\\'Why, where\\'s our Martha?\\' cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\\n\\n\\'Not coming,\\' said Mrs. Cratchit.\\n\\n\\'Not coming!\\' said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;\\nfor he had been Tim\\'s blood-horse all the way from church, and had come\\nhome rampant. \\'Not coming upon Christmas Day!\\'\\n\\nMartha didn\\'t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so\\nshe came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his\\narms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off\\ninto the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the\\ncopper.\\n\\n\\'And how did little Tim behave?\\' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had\\nrallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his\\nheart\\'s content.\\n\\n\\'As good as gold,\\' said Bob, \\'and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful,\\nsitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever\\nheard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the\\nchurch, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to\\nremember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men\\nsee.\\'\\n\\nBob\\'s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when\\nhe said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\\n\\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and\\nsister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his\\ncuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more\\nshabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and\\nstirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master\\nPeter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose,\\nwith which they soon returned in high procession.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of\\ncourse--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.\\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\\nbreathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\\nand when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and\\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\\n\\n[Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM\\'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]\\n\\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn\\'t believe there ever was\\nsuch a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,\\nwere the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and\\nmashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;\\nindeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn\\'t ate it all at last! Yet every\\none had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were\\nsteeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being\\nchanged by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous\\nto bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.\\n\\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and\\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\\nthe two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\\nsupposed.\\n\\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\\na pastry-cook\\'s next door to each other, with a laundress\\'s next door to\\nthat! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled\\ncannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of\\nignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\\n\\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\\nthing.\\n\\n[Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]\\n\\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and\\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\\nshovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family\\ndrew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half\\na one; and at Bob Cratchit\\'s elbow stood the family display of glass.\\nTwo tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\\n\\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\\nproposed:\\n\\n\\'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\\'\\n\\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\\n\\n\\'God bless us every one!\\' said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\\n\\nHe sat very close to his father\\'s side, upon his little stool. Bob held\\nhis withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\\n\\n\\'Spirit,\\' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, \\'tell\\nme if Tiny Tim will live.\\'\\n\\n\\'I see a vacant seat,\\' replied the Ghost, \\'in the poor chimney corner,\\nand a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows\\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.\\'\\n\\n\\'No, no,\\' said Scrooge. \\'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.\\'\\n\\n\\'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,\\'\\nreturned the Ghost, \\'will find him here. What then? If he be like to\\ndie, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\\'\\n\\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and\\nwas overcome with penitence and grief.\\n\\n\\'Man,\\' said the Ghost, \\'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear\\nthat wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and\\nwhere it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It\\nmay be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit\\nto live than millions like this poor man\\'s child. O God! to hear the\\ninsect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry\\nbrothers in the dust!\\'\\n\\nScrooge bent before the Ghost\\'s rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes\\nupon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.\\n\\n\\'Mr. Scrooge!\\' said Bob. \\'I\\'ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the\\nFeast!\\'\\n\\n\\'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!\\' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. \\'I\\nwish I had him here. I\\'d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and\\nI hope he\\'d have a good appetite for it.\\'\\n\\n\\'My dear,\\' said Bob, \\'the children! Christmas Day.\\'\\n\\n\\'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\\' said she, \\'on which one drinks\\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\\npoor fellow!\\'\\n\\n\\'My dear!\\' was Bob\\'s mild answer. \\'Christmas Day.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll drink his health for your sake and the Day\\'s,\\' said Mrs. Cratchit,\\n\\'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\\nHe\\'ll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!\\'\\n\\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\\nproceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of\\nall, but he didn\\'t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\\n\\nAfter it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from\\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter\\'s being a man\\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner\\'s,\\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\\n\\'was much about as tall as Peter\\'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\\nso high that you couldn\\'t have seen his head if you had been there. All\\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\\n\\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker\\'s. But they were happy, grateful,\\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit\\'s\\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\\nTim, until the last.\\n\\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\\nThere, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\\nfirst to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of\\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\\nneighbour\\'s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\\nenter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\\n\\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its\\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\\nhe had any company but Christmas.\\n\\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\\nitself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost\\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,\\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\\ndarkest night.\\n\\n\\'What place is this?\\' asked Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,\\'\\nreturned the Spirit. \\'But they know me. See!\\'\\n\\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\\nwoman, with their children and their children\\'s children, and another\\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\\nagain.\\n\\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\\nScrooge\\'s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\\n\\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\\n\\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\\n\\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\\nhim.\\n\\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of\\nthe wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the\\nlonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as\\nprofound as death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus\\nengaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to\\nScrooge to recognise it as his own nephew\\'s and to find himself in a\\nbright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his\\nside, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\\n\\n\\'Ha, ha!\\' laughed Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'Ha, ha, ha!\\'\\n\\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blessed\\nin a laugh than Scrooge\\'s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to\\nknow him too. Introduce him to me, and I\\'ll cultivate his acquaintance.\\n\\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there\\nis infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so\\nirresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge\\'s\\nnephew laughed in this way--holding his sides, rolling his head, and\\ntwisting his face into the most extravagant contortions--Scrooge\\'s\\nniece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled\\nfriends, being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\\n\\n\\'Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!\\'\\n\\n\\'He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\\' cried Scrooge\\'s\\nnephew. \\'He believed it, too!\\'\\n\\n\\'More shame for him, Fred!\\' said Scrooge\\'s niece indignantly. Bless\\nthose women! they never do anything by halves. They are always in\\nearnest.\\n\\nShe was very pretty; exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\\nsurprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made\\nto be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about\\nher chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the\\nsunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature\\'s head.\\nAltogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but\\nsatisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory!\\n\\n\\'He\\'s a comical old fellow,\\' said Scrooge\\'s nephew, \\'that\\'s the truth;\\nand not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their\\nown punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m sure he is very rich, Fred,\\' hinted Scrooge\\'s niece. \\'At least, you\\nalways tell _me_ so.\\'\\n\\n\\'What of that, my dear?\\' said Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'His wealth is of no use\\nto him. He don\\'t do any good with it. He don\\'t make himself comfortable\\nwith it. He hasn\\'t the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is\\never going to benefit Us with it.\\'\\n\\n\\'I have no patience with him,\\' observed Scrooge\\'s niece. Scrooge\\'s\\nniece\\'s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\\n\\n\\'Oh, I have!\\' said Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'I am sorry for him; I couldn\\'t be\\nangry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself always.\\nHere he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won\\'t come and dine\\nwith us. What\\'s the consequence? He don\\'t lose much of a dinner.\\'\\n\\n\\'Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\\' interrupted Scrooge\\'s\\nniece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have\\nbeen competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and with the\\ndessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\\n\\n\\'Well! I am very glad to hear it,\\' said Scrooge\\'s nephew, \\'because I\\nhaven\\'t any great faith in these young housekeepers. What do _you_ say,\\nTopper?\\'\\n\\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge\\'s niece\\'s sisters,\\nfor he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right\\nto express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge\\'s niece\\'s\\nsister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the\\nroses--blushed.\\n\\n\\'Do go on, Fred,\\' said Scrooge\\'s niece, clapping her hands. \\'He never\\nfinishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!\\'\\n\\nScrooge\\'s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to\\nkeep the infection off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with\\naromatic vinegar, his example was unanimously followed.\\n\\n\\'I was only going to say,\\' said Scrooge\\'s nephew, \\'that the consequence\\nof his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I\\nthink, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.\\nI am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own\\nthoughts, either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers. I mean\\nto give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for\\nI pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can\\'t help\\nthinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good\\ntemper, year after year, and saying, \"Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\" If it\\nonly put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that\\'s_\\nsomething; and I think I shook him yesterday.\\'\\n\\nIt was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\\nBut being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed\\nat, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their\\nmerriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.\\n\\nAfter tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew\\nwhat they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:\\nespecially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and\\nnever swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over\\nit. Scrooge\\'s niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other\\ntunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle\\nit in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched\\nScrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost\\nof Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things\\nthat Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;\\nand thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he\\nmight have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with\\nhis own hands, without resorting to the sexton\\'s spade that buried Jacob\\nMarley.\\n\\n[Illustration: _The way he went after that plump sister in the lace\\ntucker!_]\\n\\nBut they didn\\'t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they\\nplayed at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never\\nbetter than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.\\nStop! There was first a game at blind man\\'s-buff. Of course there was.\\nAnd I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes\\nin his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and\\nScrooge\\'s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The\\nway he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on\\nthe credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling\\nover the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself\\namongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew\\nwhere the plump sister was. He wouldn\\'t catch anybody else. If you had\\nfallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have\\nmade a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an\\naffront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\\nthe direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn\\'t\\nfair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in\\nspite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\\nhe got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\\nwas the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his\\npretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to\\nassure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\\nfinger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No\\ndoubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in\\noffice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\\n\\nScrooge\\'s niece was not one of the blind man\\'s-buff party, but was made\\ncomfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where\\nthe Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\\nforfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\\nalphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\\ngreat, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge\\'s nephew, beat her sisters\\nhollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\\nThere might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all\\nplayed, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he\\nhad in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he\\nsometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed\\nright, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to\\ncut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge, blunt as he took it in\\nhis head to be.\\n\\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon\\nhim with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay\\nuntil the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\\n\\n\\'Here is a new game,\\' said Scrooge. \\'One half-hour, Spirit, only one!\\'\\n\\nIt was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge\\'s nephew had to think of\\nsomething, and the rest must find out what, he only answering to their\\nquestions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to\\nwhich he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an\\nanimal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\\nanimal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes and\\nlived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn\\'t made a show\\nof, and wasn\\'t led by anybody, and didn\\'t live in a menagerie, and was\\nnever killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a\\nbull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every\\nfresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar\\nof laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to\\nget up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a\\nsimilar state, cried out:\\n\\n\\'I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!\\'\\n\\n\\'What is it?\\' cried Fred.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge.\\'\\n\\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though\\nsome objected that the reply to \\'Is it a bear?\\' ought to have been\\n\\'Yes\\'; inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have\\ndiverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had\\nany tendency that way.\\n\\n\\'He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,\\' said Fred, \\'and it\\nwould be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled\\nwine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, \"Uncle Scrooge!\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Well! Uncle Scrooge!\\' they cried.\\n\\n\\'A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!\\'\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'He wouldn\\'t take it from me, but may he have it,\\nnevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!\\'\\n\\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that\\nhe would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked\\nthem in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the\\nwhole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\\nnephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\\n\\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but\\nalways with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick-beds, and they\\nwere cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by\\nstruggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,\\nand it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and gaol, in misery\\'s every\\nrefuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast\\nthe door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing and taught\\nScrooge his precepts.\\n\\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts\\nof this, because the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into\\nthe space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that, while\\nScrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older,\\nclearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it\\nuntil they left a children\\'s Twelfth-Night party, when, looking at the\\nSpirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair\\nwas grey.\\n\\n\\'Are spirits\\' lives so short?\\' asked Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'My life upon this globe is very brief,\\' replied the Ghost. \\'It ends\\nto-night.\\'\\n\\n\\'To-night!\\' cried Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.\\'\\n\\nThe chimes were ringing the three-quarters past eleven at that moment.\\n\\n\\'Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,\\' said Scrooge, looking\\nintently at the Spirit\\'s robe, \\'but I see something strange, and not\\nbelonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a\\nclaw?\\'\\n\\n\\'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,\\' was the Spirit\\'s\\nsorrowful reply. \\'Look here!\\'\\n\\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\\nupon the outside of its garment.\\n\\n\\'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!\\' exclaimed the Ghost.\\n\\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\\ndread.\\n\\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\\n\\n\\'Spirit! are they yours?\\' Scrooge could say no more.\\n\\n\\'They are Man\\'s,\\' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. \\'And they\\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!\\' cried the Spirit, stretching out\\nhis hand towards the city. \\'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!\\'\\n\\n\\'Have they no refuge or resource?\\' cried Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Are there no prisons?\\' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\\ntime with his own words. \\'Are there no workhouses?\\'\\n\\nThe bell struck Twelve.\\n\\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\\n\\n\\nSTAVE FOUR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\\n\\n\\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\\n\\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\\nsurrounded.\\n\\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\\n\\n\\'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?\\' said\\nScrooge.\\n\\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\\n\\n\\'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\\nbut will happen in the time before us,\\' Scrooge pursued. \\'Is that so,\\nSpirit?\\'\\n\\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\\nhe received.\\n\\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\\nrecover.\\n\\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\\nheap of black.\\n\\n\\'Ghost of the Future!\\' he exclaimed, \\'I fear you more than any spectre\\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?\\'\\n\\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\\n\\n\\'Lead on!\\' said Scrooge. \\'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!\\'\\n\\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\\nalong.\\n\\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\\nwere in the heart of it; on \\'Change, amongst the merchants, who hurried\\nup and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\\ngroups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their\\ngreat gold seals, and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\\n\\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing\\nthat the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their\\ntalk.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \\'I don\\'t know much\\nabout it either way. I only know he\\'s dead.\\'\\n\\n\\'When did he die?\\' inquired another.\\n\\n\\'Last night, I believe.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why, what was the matter with him?\\' asked a third, taking a vast\\nquantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. \\'I thought he\\'d never\\ndie.\\'\\n\\n\\'God knows,\\' said the first, with a yawn.\\n\\n\\'What has he done with his money?\\' asked a red-faced gentleman with a\\npendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills\\nof a turkey-cock.\\n\\n\\'I haven\\'t heard,\\' said the man with the large chin, yawning again.\\n\\'Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn\\'t left it to _me_. That\\'s all\\nI know.\\'\\n\\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s likely to be a very cheap funeral,\\' said the same speaker; \\'for,\\nupon my life, I don\\'t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a\\nparty, and volunteer?\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t mind going if a lunch is provided,\\' observed the gentleman with\\nthe excrescence on his nose. \\'But I must be fed if I make one.\\'\\n\\nAnother laugh.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n  _\"How are you?\" said one.\\n   \"How are you?\" returned the other.\\n   \"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\"_\\n\\n]\\n\\n\\'Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\\' said the first\\nspeaker, \\'for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I\\'ll\\noffer to go if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I\\'m not\\nat all sure that I wasn\\'t his most particular friend; for we used to\\nstop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!\\'\\n\\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.\\nScrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\\n\\nThe phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons\\nmeeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie\\nhere.\\n\\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very\\nwealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing\\nwell in their esteem in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a\\nbusiness point of view.\\n\\n\\'How are you?\\' said one.\\n\\n\\'How are you?\\' returned the other.\\n\\n\\'Well!\\' said the first, \\'old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\\'\\n\\n\\'So I am told,\\' returned the second. \\'Cold, isn\\'t it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Seasonable for Christmas-time. You are not a skater, I suppose?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, no. Something else to think of. Good-morning!\\'\\n\\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their\\nparting.\\n\\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should\\nattach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling\\nassured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to\\nconsider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to\\nhave any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was\\nPast, and this Ghost\\'s province was the Future. Nor could he think of\\nany one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them.\\nBut nothing doubting that, to whomsoever they applied, they had some\\nlatent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every\\nword he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\\nshadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the\\nconduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would\\nrender the solution of these riddles easy.\\n\\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man\\nstood in his accustomed corner; and though the clock pointed to his\\nusual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among\\nthe multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little\\nsurprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of\\nlife, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out\\nin this.\\n\\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched\\nhand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,\\nfrom the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,\\nthat the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,\\nand feel very cold.\\n\\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,\\nwhere Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its\\nsituation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop\\nand houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\\nsmell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole\\nquarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\\n\\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling\\nshop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and\\ngreasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of\\nrusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse\\niron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred\\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\\ncharcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly\\nseventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without\\nby a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and\\nsmoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\\n\\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a\\nwoman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely\\nentered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was\\nclosely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by\\nthe sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.\\nAfter a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with\\nthe pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\\n\\n\\'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\\' cried she who had entered\\nfirst. \\'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the\\nundertaker\\'s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here\\'s a\\nchance! If we haven\\'t all three met here without meaning it!\\'\\n\\n\\'You couldn\\'t have met in a better place,\\' said old Joe, removing his\\npipe from his mouth. \\'Come into the parlour. You were made free of it\\nlong ago, you know; and the other two an\\'t strangers. Stop till I shut\\nthe door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an\\'t such a rusty bit of\\nmetal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I\\'m sure there\\'s no\\nsuch old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We\\'re all suitable to our calling,\\nwe\\'re well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.\\'\\n\\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked\\nthe fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky\\nlamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth\\nagain.\\n\\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on\\nthe floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her\\nelbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\\n\\n\\'What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\\' said the woman. \\'Every person\\nhas a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did!\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s true, indeed!\\' said the laundress. \\'No man more so.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why, then, don\\'t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman! Who\\'s the\\nwiser? We\\'re not going to pick holes in each other\\'s coats, I suppose?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, indeed!\\' said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. \\'We should hope\\nnot.\\'\\n\\n\\'Very well then!\\' cried the woman. \\'That\\'s enough. Who\\'s the worse for\\nthe loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, indeed,\\' said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\\n\\n\\'If he wanted to keep \\'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,\\'\\npursued the woman, \\'why wasn\\'t he natural in his lifetime? If he had\\nbeen, he\\'d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with\\nDeath, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s the truest word that ever was spoke,\\' said Mrs. Dilber. \\'It\\'s a\\njudgment on him.\\'\\n\\n\\'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\\' replied the woman: \\'and it\\nshould have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands\\non anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value\\nof it. Speak out plain. I\\'m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for\\nthem to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves\\nbefore we met here, I believe. It\\'s no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.\\'\\n\\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in\\nfaded black, mounting the breach first, produced _his_ plunder. It was\\nnot extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons,\\nand a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined\\nand appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give\\nfor each upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found\\nthat there was nothing more to come.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s your account,\\' said Joe, \\'and I wouldn\\'t give another sixpence,\\nif I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who\\'s next?\\'\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: _\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains.\"_]\\n\\nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two\\nold fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few\\nboots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.\\n\\n\\'I always give too much to ladies. It\\'s a weakness of mine, and that\\'s\\nthe way I ruin myself,\\' said old Joe. \\'That\\'s your account. If you asked\\nme for another penny, and made it an open question, I\\'d repent of being\\nso liberal, and knock off half-a-crown.\\'\\n\\n\\'And now undo _my_ bundle, Joe,\\' said the first woman.\\n\\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it,\\nand, having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large heavy\\nroll of some dark stuff.\\n\\n\\'What do you call this?\\' said Joe. \\'Bed-curtains?\\'\\n\\n\\'Ah!\\' returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed\\narms. \\'Bed-curtains!\\'\\n\\n\\'You don\\'t mean to say you took \\'em down, rings and all, with him lying\\nthere?\\' said Joe.\\n\\n\\'Yes, I do,\\' replied the woman. \\'Why not?\\'\\n\\n\\'You were born to make your fortune,\\' said Joe, \\'and you\\'ll certainly do\\nit.\\'\\n\\n\\'I certainly shan\\'t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by\\nreaching it out, for the sake of such a man as he was, I promise you,\\nJoe,\\' returned the woman coolly. \\'Don\\'t drop that oil upon the blankets,\\nnow.\\'\\n\\n\\'His blankets?\\' asked Joe.\\n\\n\\'Whose else\\'s do you think?\\' replied the woman. \\'He isn\\'t likely to take\\ncold without \\'em, I dare say.\\'\\n\\n\\'I hope he didn\\'t die of anything catching? Eh?\\' said old Joe, stopping\\nin his work, and looking up.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you be afraid of that,\\' returned the woman. \\'I an\\'t so fond of\\nhis company that I\\'d loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah!\\nyou may look through that shirt till your eyes ache, but you won\\'t find\\na hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It\\'s the best he had, and a fine\\none too. They\\'d have wasted it, if it hadn\\'t been for me.\\'\\n\\n\\'What do you call wasting of it?\\' asked old Joe.\\n\\n\\'Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\\' replied the woman, with\\na laugh. \\'Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If\\ncalico an\\'t good enough for such a purpose, it isn\\'t good enough for\\nanything. It\\'s quite as becoming to the body. He can\\'t look uglier than\\nhe did in that one.\\'\\n\\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about\\ntheir spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man\\'s lamp, he\\nviewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been\\ngreater, though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse\\nitself.\\n\\n\\'Ha, ha!\\' laughed the same woman when old Joe producing a flannel bag\\nwith money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. \\'This\\nis the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he\\nwas alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\\'\\n\\n\\'Spirit!\\' said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \\'I see, I see. The\\ncase of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now.\\nMerciful heaven, what is this?\\'\\n\\nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost\\ntouched a bed--a bare, uncurtained bed--on which, beneath a ragged\\nsheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,\\nannounced itself in awful language.\\n\\nThe room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,\\nthough Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,\\nanxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the\\nouter air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft,\\nunwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\\n\\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the\\nhead. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of\\nit, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge\\'s part, would have disclosed the\\nface. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to\\ndo it; but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the\\nspectre at his side.\\n\\nOh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and\\ndress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command; for this is thy\\ndominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not\\nturn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\\nnot that the hand is heavy, and will fall down when released; it is not\\nthat the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open,\\ngenerous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender, and the pulse a\\nman\\'s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the\\nwound, to sow the world with life immortal!\\n\\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge\\'s ears, and yet he heard them\\nwhen he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up\\nnow, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping\\ncares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\\n\\nHe lay in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child to\\nsay he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind\\nword I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\\na sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone. What _they_ wanted in\\nthe room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge\\ndid not dare to think.\\n\\n\\'Spirit!\\' he said, \\'this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not\\nleave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\\'\\n\\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\\n\\n\\'I understand you,\\' Scrooge returned, \\'and I would do it if I could. But\\nI have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.\\'\\n\\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\\n\\n\\'If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this\\nman\\'s death,\\' said Scrooge, quite agonised, \\'show that person to me,\\nSpirit, I beseech you!\\'\\n\\nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;\\nand, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her\\nchildren were.\\n\\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked\\nup and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the\\nwindow, glanced at the clock, tried, but in vain, to work with her\\nneedle, and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.\\n\\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,\\nand met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though\\nhe was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of\\nserious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to\\nrepress.\\n\\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,\\nand when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a\\nlong silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\\n\\n\\'Is it good,\\' she said, \\'or bad?\\' to help him.\\n\\n\\'Bad,\\' he answered.\\n\\n\\'We are quite ruined?\\'\\n\\n\\'No. There is hope yet, Caroline.\\'\\n\\n\\'If _he_ relents,\\' she said, amazed, \\'there is! Nothing is past hope, if\\nsuch a miracle has happened.\\'\\n\\n\\'He is past relenting,\\' said her husband. \\'He is dead.\\'\\n\\nShe was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she\\nwas thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands.\\nShe prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was\\nthe emotion of her heart.\\n\\n\\'What the half-drunken woman, whom I told you of last night, said to me\\nwhen I tried to see him and obtain a week\\'s delay--and what I thought\\nwas a mere excuse to avoid me--turns out to have been quite true. He was\\nnot only very ill, but dying, then.\\'\\n\\n\\'To whom will our debt be transferred?\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know. But, before that time, we shall be ready with the money;\\nand even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so\\nmerciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light\\nhearts, Caroline!\\'\\n\\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children\\'s\\nfaces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little\\nunderstood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man\\'s\\ndeath! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the\\nevent, was one of pleasure.\\n\\n\\'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\\' said Scrooge; \\'or\\nthat dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever\\npresent to me.\\'\\n\\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;\\nand as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,\\nbut nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit\\'s house;\\nthe dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the\\nchildren seated round the fire.\\n\\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues\\nin one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.\\nThe mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they\\nwere very quiet!\\n\\n\\'\"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.\"\\'\\n\\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy\\nmust have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why\\ndid he not go on?\\n\\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her\\nface.\\n\\n\\'The colour hurts my eyes,\\' she said.\\n\\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\\n\\n\\'They\\'re better now again,\\' said Cratchit\\'s wife. \\'It makes them weak by\\ncandle-light; and I wouldn\\'t show weak eyes to your father when he comes\\nhome for the world. It must be near his time.\\'\\n\\n\\'Past it rather,\\' Peter answered, shutting up his book. \\'But I think he\\nhas walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings,\\nmother.\\'\\n\\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful\\nvoice, that only faltered once:\\n\\n\\'I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon\\nhis shoulder very fast indeed.\\'\\n\\n\\'And so have I,\\' cried Peter. \\'Often.\\'\\n\\n\\'And so have I,\\' exclaimed another. So had all.\\n\\n\\'But he was very light to carry,\\' she resumed, intent upon her work,\\n\\'and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble, no trouble. And\\nthere is your father at the door!\\'\\n\\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter--he had\\nneed of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob,\\nand they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young\\nCratchits got upon his knees, and laid, each child, a little cheek\\nagainst his face, as if they said, \\'Don\\'t mind it, father. Don\\'t be\\ngrieved!\\'\\n\\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.\\nHe looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed\\nof Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,\\nhe said.\\n\\n\\'Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\\' said his wife.\\n\\n\\'Yes, my dear,\\' returned Bob. \\'I wish you could have gone. It would have\\ndone you good to see how green a place it is. But you\\'ll see it often. I\\npromised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little\\nchild!\\' cried Bob. \\'My little child!\\'\\n\\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn\\'t help it. If he could have helped\\nit, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they\\nwere.\\n\\nHe left the room, and went upstairs into the room above, which was\\nlighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close\\nbeside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there\\nlately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and\\ncomposed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\\nhad happened, and went down again quite happy.\\n\\nThey drew about the fire, and talked, the girls and mother working\\nstill. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge\\'s\\nnephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the\\nstreet that day, and seeing that he looked a little--\\'just a little\\ndown, you know,\\' said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him.\\n\\'On which,\\' said Bob, \\'for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you\\never heard, I told him. \"I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,\" he\\nsaid, \"and heartily sorry for your good wife.\" By-the-bye, how he ever\\nknew _that_ I don\\'t know.\\'\\n\\n\\'Knew what, my dear?\\'\\n\\n\\'Why, that you were a good wife,\\' replied Bob.\\n\\n\\'Everybody knows that,\\' said Peter.\\n\\n\\'Very well observed, my boy!\\' cried Bob. \\'I hope they do. \"Heartily\\nsorry,\" he said, \"for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in\\nany way,\" he said, giving me his card, \"that\\'s where I live. Pray come\\nto me.\" Now, it wasn\\'t,\\' cried Bob, \\'for the sake of anything he might\\nbe able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite\\ndelightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt\\nwith us.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m sure he\\'s a good soul!\\' said Mrs. Cratchit.\\n\\n\\'You would be sure of it, my dear,\\' returned Bob, \\'if you saw and spoke\\nto him. I shouldn\\'t be at all surprised--mark what I say!--if he got\\nPeter a better situation.\\'\\n\\n\\'Only hear that, Peter,\\' said Mrs. Cratchit.\\n\\n\\'And then,\\' cried one of the girls, \\'Peter will be keeping company with\\nsome one, and setting up for himself.\\'\\n\\n\\'Get along with you!\\' retorted Peter, grinning.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s just as likely as not,\\' said Bob, \\'one of these days; though\\nthere\\'s plenty of time for that, my dear. But, however and whenever we\\npart from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny\\nTim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us?\\'\\n\\n\\'Never, father!\\' cried they all.\\n\\n\\'And I know,\\' said Bob, \\'I know, my dears, that when we recollect how\\npatient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we\\nshall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in\\ndoing it.\\'\\n\\n\\'No, never, father!\\' they all cried again.\\n\\n\\'I am very happy,\\' said little Bob, \\'I am very happy!\\'\\n\\nMrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young\\nCratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny\\nTim, thy childish essence was from God!\\n\\n\\'Spectre,\\' said Scrooge, \\'something informs me that our parting moment\\nis at hand. I know it but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom\\nwe saw lying dead?\\'\\n\\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come conveyed him, as before--though at a\\ndifferent time, he thought: indeed there seemed no order in these latter\\nvisions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of business\\nmen, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for\\nanything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until\\nbesought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\\n\\n\\'This court,\\' said Scrooge, \\'through which we hurry now, is where my\\nplace of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the\\nhouse. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come.\\'\\n\\nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\\n\\n\\'The house is yonder,\\' Scrooge exclaimed. \\'Why do you point away?\\'\\n\\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.\\n\\nScrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an\\noffice still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the\\nfigure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.\\n\\nHe joined it once again, and, wondering why and whither he had gone,\\naccompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round\\nbefore entering.\\n\\nA churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man, whose name he had now to\\nlearn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by\\nhouses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation\\'s death,\\nnot life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A\\nworthy place!\\n\\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced\\ntowards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he\\ndreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\\n\\n\\'Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\\' said Scrooge,\\n\\'answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will\\nbe, or are they shadows of the things that May be only?\\'\\n\\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\\n\\n\\'Men\\'s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in,\\nthey must lead,\\' said Scrooge. \\'But if the courses be departed from, the\\nends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!\\'\\n\\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\\n\\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and, following the\\nfinger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name,\\nEBENEZER SCROOGE.\\n\\n\\'Am I that man who lay upon the bed?\\' he cried upon his knees.\\n\\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\\n\\n\\'No, Spirit! Oh no, no!\\'\\n\\nThe finger still was there.\\n\\n\\'Spirit!\\' he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \\'hear me! I am not the\\nman I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this\\nintercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?\\'\\n\\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.\\n\\n\\'Good Spirit,\\' he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it,\\n\\'your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may\\nchange these shadows you have shown me by an altered life?\\'\\n\\nThe kind hand trembled.\\n\\n\\'I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I\\nwill live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all\\nThree shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they\\nteach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!\\'\\n\\nIn his agony he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but\\nhe was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit stronger yet,\\nrepulsed him.\\n\\nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw\\nan alteration in the Phantom\\'s hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and\\ndwindled down into a bedpost.\\n\\n\\nSTAVE FIVE\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE END OF IT\\n\\n\\nYes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his\\nown. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make\\namends in!\\n\\n\\'I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\\' Scrooge repeated\\nas he scrambled out of bed. \\'The Spirits of all Three shall strive\\nwithin me. O Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas Time be praised for\\nthis! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!\\'\\n\\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his\\nbroken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing\\nviolently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with\\ntears.\\n\\n\\'They are not torn down,\\' cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains\\nin his arms, \\'They are not torn down, rings and all. They are here--I am\\nhere--the shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled.\\nThey will be. I know they will!\\'\\n\\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time: turning them inside\\nout, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making\\nthem parties to every kind of extravagance.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know what to do!\\' cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the\\nsame breath, and making a perfect Laocoon of himself with his stockings.\\n\\'I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as\\na schoolboy, I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to\\neverybody! A happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!\\'\\n\\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there,\\nperfectly winded.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s the saucepan that the gruel was in!\\' cried Scrooge, starting\\noff again, and going round the fireplace. \\'There\\'s the door by which the\\nGhost of Jacob Marley entered! There\\'s the corner where the Ghost of\\nChristmas Present sat! There\\'s the window where I saw the wandering\\nSpirits! It\\'s all right, it\\'s all true, it all happened. Ha, ha, ha!\\'\\n\\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was\\na splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long\\nline of brilliant laughs!\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know what day of the month it is,\\' said Scrooge. \\'I don\\'t know\\nhow long I have been among the Spirits. I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m quite\\na baby. Never mind. I don\\'t care. I\\'d rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!\\nHallo here!\\'\\n\\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the\\nlustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clash, hammer; ding, dong,\\nbell! Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clash, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!\\n\\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no\\nmist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood\\nto dance to; golden sunlight; heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry\\nbells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!\\n\\n\\'What\\'s to-day?\\' cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday\\nclothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\\n\\n\\'EH?\\' returned the boy with all his might of wonder.\\n\\n\\'What\\'s to-day, my fine fellow?\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'To-day!\\' replied the boy. \\'Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s Christmas Day!\\' said Scrooge to himself. \\'I haven\\'t missed it. The\\nSpirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like.\\nOf course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!\\'\\n\\n\\'Hallo!\\' returned the boy.\\n\\n\\'Do you know the poulterer\\'s in the next street but one, at the corner?\\'\\nScrooge inquired.\\n\\n\\'I should hope I did,\\' replied the lad.\\n\\n\\'An intelligent boy!\\' said Scrooge. \\'A remarkable boy! Do you know\\nwhether they\\'ve sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?--Not\\nthe little prize turkey: the big one?\\'\\n\\n\\'What! the one as big as me?\\' returned the boy.\\n\\n\\'What a delightful boy!\\' said Scrooge. \\'It\\'s a pleasure to talk to him.\\nYes, my buck!\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s hanging there now,\\' replied the boy.\\n\\n\\'Is it?\\' said Scrooge. \\'Go and buy it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Walk-ER!\\' exclaimed the boy.\\n\\n\\'No, no,\\' said Scrooge. \\'I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell \\'em to\\nbring it here, that I may give them the directions where to take it.\\nCome back with the man, and I\\'ll give you a shilling. Come back with him\\nin less than five minutes, and I\\'ll give you half-a-crown!\\'\\n\\nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a trigger\\nwho could have got a shot off half as fast.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll send it to Bob Cratchit\\'s,\\' whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands,\\nand splitting with a laugh. \\'He shan\\'t know who sends it. It\\'s twice the\\nsize of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to\\nBob\\'s will be!\\'\\n\\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one; but write\\nit he did, somehow, and went downstairs to open the street-door, ready\\nfor the coming of the poulterer\\'s man. As he stood there, waiting his\\narrival, the knocker caught his eye.\\n\\n\\'I shall love it as long as I live!\\' cried Scrooge, patting it with his\\nhand. \\'I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it\\nhas in its face! It\\'s a wonderful knocker!--Here\\'s the turkey. Hallo!\\nWhoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!\\'\\n\\nIt _was_ a turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.\\nHe would have snapped \\'em short off in a minute, like sticks of\\nsealing-wax.\\n\\n\\'Why, it\\'s impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\\' said Scrooge. \\'You\\nmust have a cab.\\'\\n\\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid\\nfor the turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the\\nchuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by\\nthe chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\\nchuckled till he cried.\\n\\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much;\\nand shaving requires attention, even when you don\\'t dance while you are\\nat it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a\\npiece of sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.\\n\\nHe dressed himself \\'all in his best,\\' and at last got out into the\\nstreets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them\\nwith the Ghost of Christmas Present; and, walking with his hands behind\\nhim, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so\\nirresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured\\nfellows said, \\'Good-morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!\\' And Scrooge\\nsaid often afterwards that, of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,\\nthose were the blithest in his ears.\\n\\nHe had not gone far when, coming on towards him, he beheld the portly\\ngentleman who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and\\nsaid, \\'Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe?\\' It sent a pang across his heart\\nto think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but\\nhe knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\\n\\n\\'My dear sir,\\' said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old\\ngentleman by both his hands, \\'how do you do? I hope you succeeded\\nyesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\\'\\n\\n\\'Mr. Scrooge?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Scrooge. \\'That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant\\nto you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness----\\'\\nHere Scrooge whispered in his ear.\\n\\n\\'Lord bless me!\\' cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away.\\n\\'My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\\'\\n\\n\\'If you please,\\' said Scrooge. \\'Not a farthing less. A great many\\nback-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that\\nfavour?\\'\\n\\n\\'My dear sir,\\' said the other, shaking hands with him, \\'I don\\'t know\\nwhat to say to such munifi----\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t say anything, please,\\' retorted Scrooge. \\'Come and see me. Will\\nyou come and see me?\\'\\n\\n\\'I will!\\' cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.\\n\\n\\'Thankee,\\' said Scrooge. \\'I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty\\ntimes. Bless you!\\'\\n\\nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people\\nhurrying to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and questioned\\nbeggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the\\nwindows; and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had\\nnever dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much\\nhappiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew\\'s\\nhouse.\\n\\nHe passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and\\nknock. But he made a dash and did it.\\n\\n\\'Is your master at home, my dear?\\' said Scrooge to the girl. \\'Nice girl!\\nVery.\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, sir.\\'\\n\\n\\'Where is he, my love?\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'He\\'s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I\\'ll show you\\nupstairs, if you please.\\'\\n\\n\\'Thankee. He knows me,\\' said Scrooge, with his hand already on the\\ndining-room lock. \\'I\\'ll go in here, my dear.\\'\\n\\nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in round the door. They were\\nlooking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these\\nyoung housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see\\nthat everything is right.\\n\\n\\'Fred!\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had\\nforgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the\\nfootstool, or he wouldn\\'t have done it on any account.\\n\\n\\'Why, bless my soul!\\' cried Fred, \\'who\\'s that?\\'\\n\\n[Illustration: _\"It\\'s I, your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will\\nyou let me in, Fred?\"_]\\n\\n\\'It\\'s I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,\\nFred?\\'\\n\\nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn\\'t shake his arm off. He was at home in\\nfive minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same.\\nSo did Topper when _he_ came. So did the plump sister when _she_ came.\\nSo did every one when _they_ came. Wonderful party, wonderful games,\\nwonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\\n\\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there! If\\nhe could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That\\nwas the thing he had set his heart upon.\\n\\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter\\npast. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.\\nScrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the\\ntank.\\n\\nHis hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on\\nhis stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to\\novertake nine o\\'clock.\\n\\n\\'Hallo!\\' growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could\\nfeign it. \\'What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?\\'\\n\\n\\'I am very sorry, sir,\\' said Bob. \\'I _am_ behind my time.\\'\\n\\n\\'You are!\\' repeated Scrooge. \\'Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir,\\nif you please.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s only once a year, sir,\\' pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. \\'It\\nshall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.\\'\\n\\n\\'Now, I\\'ll tell you what, my friend,\\' said Scrooge. \\'I am not going to\\nstand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,\\' he continued,\\nleaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that\\nhe staggered back into the tank again--\\'and therefore I am about to\\nraise your salary!\\'\\n\\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary\\nidea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the\\npeople in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\\n\\n\\'A merry Christmas, Bob!\\' said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could\\nnot be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. \\'A merrier Christmas,\\nBob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I\\'ll raise\\nyour salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will\\ndiscuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\\nsmoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires and buy another coal-scuttle\\nbefore you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\\'\\n\\n[Illustration: _\"Now, I\\'ll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge. \"I\\nam not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.\"_]\\n\\nScrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more;\\nand to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as\\ngood a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old\\nCity knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old\\nworld. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them\\nlaugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that\\nnothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did\\nnot have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as\\nthese would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\\nshould wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less\\nattractive forms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for\\nhim.\\n\\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the\\nTotal-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of\\nhim that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed\\nthe knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as\\nTiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\\n|Transcriber\\'s note: The Contents were added by the transcriber.|\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A CHRISTMAS CAROL ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5.

For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nStop there, stop there.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\\nlonger.\\n\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nHere’s goodly gear!\\nA sail, a sail!\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nPeter!\\n\\nPETER.\\nAnon.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nMy fan, Peter.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIs it good-den?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\\nprick of noon.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\\nfault of a worse.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nYou say well.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nShe will endite him to some supper.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat hast thou found?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\\n[_Sings._]\\n    An old hare hoar,\\n    And an old hare hoar,\\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\\n    But a hare that is hoar\\n    Is too much for a score\\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI will follow you.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\n\\nNURSE.\\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\\nropery?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\\nuse me at his pleasure!\\n\\nPETER.\\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\\nvery weak dealing.\\n\\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\nthee,—\\n\\nNURSE.\\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\\nbe a joyful woman.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\\ngentlemanlike offer.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nBid her devise\\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGo to; I say you shall.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nCommend me to thy lady.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\\n\\n [_Exit Romeo._]\\n\\nPETER.\\nAnon.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nBefore and apace.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.\\n\\n Enter Juliet.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,\\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.\\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,\\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\\nTherefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve\\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\\nShe’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\\nAnd his to me.\\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\\n\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\n\\nO God, she comes.

Do you not see that I am\\nout of breath?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\\nMy back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\\nSweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\\nAnd I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nWhere is my mother?

Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\\n\\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\\nAnd in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\n\\n Enter Juliet.\\n\\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\nSCENE I. A public Place.\\n\\n\\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\\nAnd if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\\na tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no\\nneed of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\\ndrawer, when indeed there is no need.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAm I like such a fellow?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as\\nsoon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAnd what to?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would\\nkill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\ntutor me from quarrelling!\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThe fee simple! O simple!\\n\\n Enter Tybalt and others.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nBy my heel, I care not.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\\nword and a blow.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\\noccasion.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\\n\\n Enter Romeo.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nCome, sir, your passado.\\n\\n [_They fight._]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\\nHold, Tybalt!

Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\\n\\n [_Exit Page._]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\\narm.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI thought all for the best.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\\nThey have made worms’ meat of me.\\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!\\n\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\\nHath been my cousin.

Prince, as thou art true,\\nFor blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\\nO cousin, cousin.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;\\nRomeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal\\nYour high displeasure. All this uttered\\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\\nThe life of Tybalt.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nAnd for that offence\\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\\nBear hence this body, and attend our will.\\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE II.

Therefore hence, be gone.\\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry\\nIn what I further shall intend to do,\\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,\\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;\\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nSo shalt thou show me friendship.

I think\\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?\\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.\\nI’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\nA grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,\\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.\\n\\n [_Laying Paris in the monument._]\\n\\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\\nHave they been merry! Which their keepers call\\nA lightning before death. O, how may I\\nCall this a lightning? O my love, my wife,\\nDeath that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,\\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\nThou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet\\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\nAnd death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;\\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee,\\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\nWill I set up my everlasting rest;\\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you\\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\\nHere’s to my love!

Thus with a kiss I die.\\n\\n [_Dies._]\\n\\n Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a\\n lantern, crow, and spade.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nSaint Francis be my speed.

Then comes she to me,\\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\\n\\nPAGE.\\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\\nCan I demand.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nBut I can give thee more,\\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\\nFor never was a story of more woe\\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

That was a\\nlong time ago, and when we said good-bye, we took the name with us, as\\nwe didn\\'t think the swan would want it any more. Well, when Edward Bear\\nsaid that he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christopher\\nRobin said at once, without stopping to think, that he was\\nWinnie-the-Pooh. And he was. So, as I have explained the Pooh part, I\\nwill now explain the rest of it.\\n\\nYou can\\'t be in London for long without going to the Zoo. There are some\\npeople who begin the Zoo at the beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as\\nquickly as they can past every cage until they get to the one called\\nWAYOUT, but the nicest people go straight to the animal they love the\\nmost, and stay there. So when Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes\\nto where the Polar Bears are, and he whispers something to the third\\nkeeper from the left, and doors are unlocked, and we wander through dark\\npassages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to the special cage,\\nand the cage is opened, and out trots something brown and furry, and\\nwith a happy cry of \"Oh, Bear!\" Christopher Robin rushes into its arms.\\nNow this bear\\'s name is Winnie, which shows what a good name for bears\\nit is, but the funny thing is that we can\\'t remember whether Winnie is\\ncalled after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie. We did know once, but we have\\nforgotten....\\n\\nI had written as far as this when Piglet looked up and said in his\\nsqueaky voice, \"What about _Me_?\" \"My dear Piglet,\" I said, \"the whole\\nbook is about you.\" \"So it is about Pooh,\" he squeaked. You see what it\\nis. He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is having a Grand Introduction\\nall to himself. Pooh is the favourite, of course, there\\'s no denying it,\\nbut Piglet comes in for a good many things which Pooh misses; because\\nyou can\\'t take Pooh to school without everybody knowing it, but Piglet\\nis so small that he slips into a pocket, where it is very comforting to\\nfeel him when you are not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or\\ntwenty-two. Sometimes he slips out and has a good look in the ink-pot,\\nand in this way he has got more education than Pooh, but Pooh doesn\\'t\\nmind. Some have brains, and some haven\\'t, he says, and there it is.\\n\\nAnd now all the others are saying, \"What about _Us_?\" So perhaps the\\nbest thing to do is to stop writing Introductions and get on with the\\nbook.\\n\\n                                                                A.

It is, as far as he knows,\\nthe only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there\\nreally is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and\\nthink of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn\\'t. Anyhow, here he\\nis at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\nWhen I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, \"But\\nI thought he was a boy?\"\\n\\n\"So did I,\" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"Then you can\\'t call him Winnie?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"But you said----\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don\\'t you know what \\'_ther_\\' means?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, now I do,\" I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it\\nis all the explanation you are going to get.\\n\\nSometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes\\ndownstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire\\nand listen to a story. This evening----\\n\\n\"What about a story?\" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"_What_ about a story?\" I said.\\n\\n\"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose I could,\" I said. \"What sort of stories does he like?\"\\n\\n\"About himself. Because he\\'s _that_ sort of Bear.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see.\"\\n\\n\"So could you very sweetly?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" I said.\\n\\nSo I tried.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nOnce upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday,\\nWinnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of\\nSanders.\\n\\n(_\"What does \\'under the name\\' mean?\" asked Christopher Robin._\\n\\n\"_It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived\\nunder it._\"\\n\\n_\"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn\\'t quite sure,\" said Christopher Robin._\\n\\n_\"Now I am,\" said a growly voice._\\n\\n_\"Then I will go on,\" said I._)\\n\\nOne day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle\\nof the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree,\\nand, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.\\n\\nWinnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between\\nhis paws and began to think.\\n\\nFirst of all he said to himself: \"That buzzing-noise means something.\\nYou don\\'t get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing,\\nwithout its meaning something. If there\\'s a buzzing-noise, somebody\\'s\\nmaking a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise\\nthat _I_ know of is because you\\'re a bee.\"\\n\\nThen he thought another long time, and said: \"And the only reason for\\nbeing a bee that I know of is making honey.\"\\n\\nAnd then he got up, and said: \"And the only reason for making honey is\\nso as _I_ can eat it.\" So he began to climb the tree.\\n\\nHe climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as he climbed he sang a\\nlittle song to himself. It went like this:\\n\\n    Isn\\'t it funny\\n    How a bear likes honey?\\n    Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!\\n    I wonder why he does?\\n\\nThen he climbed a little further ... and a little further ... and\\nthen just a little further. By that time he had thought of another song.\\n\\n    It\\'s a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees,\\n    They\\'d build their nests at the _bottom_ of trees.\\n    And that being so (if the Bees were Bears),\\n    We shouldn\\'t have to climb up all these stairs.\\n\\nHe was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a\\nComplaining Song. He was nearly there now, and if he just stood on that\\nbranch ...\\n\\n_Crack!_\\n\\n\"Oh, help!\" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him.\\n\\n\"If only I hadn\\'t----\" he said, as he bounced twenty feet on to the next\\nbranch.\\n\\n\"You see, what I _meant_ to do,\" he explained, as he turned\\nhead-over-heels, and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below,\\n\"what I _meant_ to do----\"\\n\\n\"Of course, it _was_ rather----\" he admitted, as he slithered very\\nquickly through the next six branches.\\n\\n\"It all comes, I suppose,\" he decided, as he said good-bye to the last\\nbranch, spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush,\\n\"it all comes of _liking_ honey so much. Oh, help!\"\\n\\nHe crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the prickles from his nose,\\nand began to think again. And the first person he thought of was\\nChristopher Robin.\\n\\n(_\"Was that me?\" said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring\\nto believe it._\\n\\n\"_That was you._\"\\n\\n_Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got larger and larger, and\\nhis face got pinker and pinker._)\\n\\nSo Winnie-the-Pooh went round to his friend Christopher Robin, who lived\\nbehind a green door in another part of the forest.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Christopher Robin,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Winnie-_ther_-Pooh,\" said you.\\n\\n\"I wonder if you\\'ve got such a thing as a balloon about you?\"\\n\\n\"A balloon?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I just said to myself coming along: \\'I wonder if Christopher Robin\\nhas such a thing as a balloon about him?\\' I just said it to myself,\\nthinking of balloons, and wondering.\"\\n\\n\"What do you want a balloon for?\" you said.\\n\\nWinnie-the-Pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening, put his\\npaw to his mouth, and said in a deep whisper: \"_Honey!_\"\\n\\n\"But you don\\'t get honey with balloons!\"\\n\\n\"_I_ do,\" said Pooh.\\n\\nWell, it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at\\nthe house of your friend Piglet, and you had balloons at the party. You\\nhad had a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit\\'s relations had had a big\\nblue one, and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a\\nparty at all; and so you had brought the green one _and_ the blue one\\nhome with you.\\n\\n\"Which one would you like?\" you asked Pooh.\\n\\nHe put his head between his paws and thought very carefully.\\n\\n\"It\\'s like this,\" he said. \"When you go after honey with a balloon, the\\ngreat thing is not to let the bees know you\\'re coming. Now, if you have\\na green balloon, they might think you were only part of the tree, and\\nnot notice you, and, if you have a blue balloon, they might think you\\nwere only part of the sky, and not notice you, and the question is:\\nWhich is most likely?\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t they notice _you_ underneath the balloon?\" you asked.\\n\\n\"They might or they might not,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"You never can\\ntell with bees.\" He thought for a moment and said: \"I shall try to look\\nlike a small black cloud. That will deceive them.\"\\n\\n\"Then you had better have the blue balloon,\" you said; and so it was\\ndecided.\\n\\nWell, you both went out with the blue balloon, and you took your gun\\nwith you, just in case, as you always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a\\nvery muddy place that he knew of, and rolled and rolled until he was\\nblack all over; and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big,\\nand you and Pooh were both holding on to the string, you let go\\nsuddenly, and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayed\\nthere--level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from\\nit.\\n\\n\"Hooray!\" you shouted.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that fine?\" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you. \"What do I look\\nlike?\"\\n\\n\"You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon,\" you said.\\n\\n\"Not,\" said Pooh anxiously, \"--not like a small black cloud in a blue\\nsky?\"\\n\\n\"Not very much.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different. And, as I say, you\\nnever can tell with bees.\"\\n\\nThere was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree, so there he stayed. He\\ncould see the honey, he could smell the honey, but he couldn\\'t quite\\nreach the honey.\\n\\nAfter a little while he called down to you.\\n\\n\"Christopher Robin!\" he said in a loud whisper.\\n\\n\"Hallo!\"\\n\\n\"I think the bees _suspect_ something!\"\\n\\n\"What sort of thing?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. But something tells me that they\\'re _suspicious_!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps they think that you\\'re after their honey.\"\\n\\n\"It may be that. You never can tell with bees.\"\\n\\nThere was another little silence, and then he called down to you again.\\n\\n\"Christopher Robin!\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"Have you an umbrella in your house?\"\\n\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up and down with it, and\\nlook up at me every now and then, and say \\'Tut-tut, it looks like rain.\\'\\nI think, if you did that, it would help the deception which we are\\npractising on these bees.\"\\n\\nWell, you laughed to yourself, \"Silly old Bear!\" but you didn\\'t say it\\naloud because you were so fond of him, and you went home for your\\numbrella.\\n\\n\"Oh, there you are!\" called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as soon as you got\\nback to the tree. \"I was beginning to get anxious. I have discovered\\nthat the bees are now definitely Suspicious.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I put my umbrella up?\" you said.\\n\\n\"Yes, but wait a moment. We must be practical. The important bee to\\ndeceive is the Queen Bee. Can you see which is the Queen Bee from down\\nthere?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying,\\n\\'Tut-tut, it looks like rain,\\' I shall do what I can by singing a little\\nCloud Song, such as a cloud might sing.... Go!\"\\n\\nSo, while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain,\\nWinnie-the-Pooh sang this song:\\n\\n    How sweet to be a Cloud\\n      Floating in the Blue!\\n    Every little cloud\\n    _Always_ sings aloud.\\n\\n    \"How sweet to be a Cloud\\n      Floating in the Blue!\"\\n    It makes him very proud\\n    To be a little cloud.\\n\\nThe bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever. Some of them,\\nindeed, left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the\\nsecond verse of this song, and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud\\nfor a moment, and then got up again.\\n\\n\"Christopher--_ow!_--Robin,\" called out the cloud.\\n\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\\n\"I have just been thinking, and I have come to a very important\\ndecision. _These are the wrong sort of bees._\"\\n\\n\"Are they?\"\\n\\n\"Quite the wrong sort. So I should think they would make the wrong sort\\nof honey, shouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Would they?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. So I think I shall come down.\"\\n\\n\"How?\" asked you.\\n\\nWinnie-the-Pooh hadn\\'t thought about this. If he let go of the string,\\nhe would fall--_bump_--and he didn\\'t like the idea of that. So he\\nthought for a long time, and then he said:\\n\\n\"Christopher Robin, you must shoot the balloon with your gun. Have you\\ngot your gun?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I have,\" you said. \"But if I do that, it will spoil the\\nballoon,\" you said.\\n\\n\"But if you _don\\'t_,\" said Pooh, \"I shall have to let go, and that would\\nspoil _me_.\"\\n\\nWhen he put it like this, you saw how it was, and you aimed very\\ncarefully at the balloon, and fired.\\n\\n\"_Ow!_\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Did I miss?\" you asked.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t exactly _miss_,\" said Pooh, \"but you missed the _balloon_.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m so sorry,\" you said, and you fired again, and this time you hit the\\nballoon, and the air came slowly out, and Winnie-the-Pooh floated down\\nto the ground.\\n\\nBut his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon\\nall that time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a\\nweek, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it\\noff. And I think--but I am not sure--that _that_ is why he was always\\ncalled Pooh.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Is that the end of the story?\" asked Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the end of that one. There are others.\"\\n\\n\"About Pooh and Me?\"\\n\\n\"And Piglet and Rabbit and all of you. Don\\'t you remember?\"\\n\\n\"I do remember, and then when I try to remember, I forget.\"\\n\\n\"That day when Pooh and Piglet tried to catch the Heffalump----\"\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t catch it, did they?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh couldn\\'t, because he hasn\\'t any brain. Did _I_ catch it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, that comes into the story.\"\\n\\nChristopher Robin nodded.\\n\\n\"I do remember,\" he said, \"only Pooh doesn\\'t very well, so that\\'s why he\\nlikes having it told to him again. Because then it\\'s a real story and\\nnot just a remembering.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just how _I_ feel,\" I said.\\n\\nChristopher Robin gave a deep sigh, picked his Bear up by the leg, and\\nwalked off to the door, trailing Pooh behind him. At the door he turned\\nand said, \"Coming to see me have my bath?\"\\n\\n\"I might,\" I said.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t hurt him when I shot him, did I?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit.\"\\n\\nHe nodded and went out, and in a moment I heard Winnie-the-Pooh--_bump,\\nbump, bump_--going up the stairs behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER II\\n\\n                     IN WHICH POOH GOES VISITING AND\\n                         GETS INTO A TIGHT PLACE\\n\\n\\nEdward Bear, known to his friends as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for\\nshort, was walking through the forest one day, humming proudly to\\nhimself. He had made up a little hum that very morning, as he was doing\\nhis Stoutness Exercises in front of the glass: _Tra-la-la, tra-la-la_,\\nas he stretched up as high as he could go, and then _Tra-la-la,\\ntra-la--oh, help!--la_, as he tried to reach his toes. After breakfast\\nhe had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by\\nheart, and now he was humming it right through, properly. It went like\\nthis:\\n\\n      _Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,_\\n      _Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,_\\n    _Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum._\\n      _Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,_\\n      _Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,_\\n    _Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um._\\n\\nWell, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily,\\nwondering what everybody else was doing, and what it felt like, being\\nsomebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank\\nwas a large hole.\\n\\n\"Aha!\" said Pooh. (_Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum._) \"If I know anything about\\nanything, that hole means Rabbit,\" he said, \"and Rabbit means Company,\"\\nhe said, \"and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me-Humming and such\\nlike. _Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um._\"\\n\\nSo he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called out:\\n\\n\"Is anybody at home?\"\\n\\nThere was a sudden scuffling noise from inside the hole, and then\\nsilence.\\n\\n\"What I said was, \\'Is anybody at home?\\'\" called out Pooh very loudly.\\n\\n\"No!\" said a voice; and then added, \"You needn\\'t shout so loud. I heard\\nyou quite well the first time.\"\\n\\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"Isn\\'t there anybody here at all?\"\\n\\n\"Nobody.\"\\n\\nWinnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole, and thought for a little,\\nand he thought to himself, \"There must be somebody there, because\\nsomebody must have _said_ \\'Nobody.\\'\" So he put his head back in the\\nhole, and said:\\n\\n\"Hallo, Rabbit, isn\\'t that you?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Rabbit, in a different sort of voice this time.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t that Rabbit\\'s voice?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t _think_ so,\" said Rabbit. \"It isn\\'t _meant_ to be.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\\n\\nHe took his head out of the hole, and had another think, and then he put\\nit back, and said:\\n\\n\"Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?\"\\n\\n\"He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is a great friend of his.\"\\n\\n\"But this _is_ Me!\" said Bear, very much surprised.\\n\\n\"What sort of Me?\"\\n\\n\"Pooh Bear.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\" said Rabbit, still more surprised.\\n\\n\"Quite, quite sure,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Oh, well, then, come in.\"\\n\\nSo Pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole, and at\\nlast he got in.\\n\\n\"You were quite right,\" said Rabbit, looking at him all over. \"It _is_\\nyou. Glad to see you.\"\\n\\n\"Who did you think it was?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I wasn\\'t sure. You know how it is in the Forest. One can\\'t have\\n_anybody_ coming into one\\'s house. One has to be _careful_. What about a\\nmouthful of something?\"\\n\\nPooh always liked a little something at eleven o\\'clock in the morning,\\nand he was very glad to see Rabbit getting out the plates and mugs; and\\nwhen Rabbit said, \"Honey or condensed milk with your bread?\" he was so\\nexcited that he said, \"Both,\" and then, so as not to seem greedy, he\\nadded, \"But don\\'t bother about the bread, please.\" And for a long time\\nafter that he said nothing ... until at last, humming to himself in a\\nrather sticky voice, he got up, shook Rabbit lovingly by the paw, and\\nsaid that he must be going on.\\n\\n\"Must you?\" said Rabbit politely.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Pooh, \"I could stay a little longer if it--if you----\" and\\nhe tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder.\\n\\n\"As a matter of fact,\" said Rabbit, \"I was going out myself directly.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, then, I\\'ll be going on. Good-bye.\"\\n\\n\"Well, good-bye, if you\\'re sure you won\\'t have any more.\"\\n\\n\"_Is_ there any more?\" asked Pooh quickly.\\n\\nRabbit took the covers off the dishes, and said, \"No, there wasn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"I thought not,\" said Pooh, nodding to himself. \"Well, good-bye. I must\\nbe going on.\"\\n\\nSo he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled with his front paws,\\nand pushed with his back paws, and in a little while his nose was out in\\nthe open again ... and then his ears ... and then his front paws ...\\nand then his shoulders ... and then----\\n\\n\"Oh, help!\" said Pooh. \"I\\'d better go back.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, bother!\" said Pooh. \"I shall have to go on.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t do either!\" said Pooh. \"Oh, help _and_ bother!\"\\n\\nNow by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too, and finding the\\nfront door full, he went out by the back door, and came round to Pooh,\\nand looked at him.\\n\\n\"Hallo, are you stuck?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"N-no,\" said Pooh carelessly. \"Just resting and thinking and humming to\\nmyself.\"\\n\\n\"Here, give us a paw.\"\\n\\nPooh Bear stretched out a paw, and Rabbit pulled and pulled and\\npulled....\\n\\n\"_Ow!_\" cried Pooh. \"You\\'re hurting!\"\\n\\n\"The fact is,\" said Rabbit, \"you\\'re stuck.\"\\n\\n\"It all comes,\" said Pooh crossly, \"of not having front doors big\\nenough.\"\\n\\n\"It all comes,\" said Rabbit sternly, \"of eating too much. I thought at\\nthe time,\" said Rabbit, \"only I didn\\'t like to say anything,\" said\\nRabbit, \"that one of us was eating too much,\" said Rabbit, \"and I knew\\nit wasn\\'t _me_,\" he said. \"Well, well, I shall go and fetch Christopher\\nRobin.\"\\n\\nChristopher Robin lived at the other end of the Forest, and when he came\\nback with Rabbit, and saw the front half of Pooh, he said, \"Silly old\\nBear,\" in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again.\\n\\n\"I was just beginning to think,\" said Bear, sniffing slightly, \"that\\nRabbit might never be able to use his front door again. And I should\\n_hate_ that,\" he said.\\n\\n\"So should I,\" said Rabbit.\\n\\n\"Use his front door again?\" said Christopher Robin. \"Of course he\\'ll use\\nhis front door again.\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" said Rabbit.\\n\\n\"If we can\\'t pull you out, Pooh, we might push you back.\"\\n\\nRabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully, and pointed out that, when\\nonce Pooh was pushed back, he was back, and of course nobody was more\\nglad to see Pooh than _he_ was, still there it was, some lived in trees\\nand some lived underground, and----\\n\\n\"You mean I\\'d _never_ get out?\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"I mean,\" said Rabbit, \"that having got _so_ far, it seems a pity to\\nwaste it.\"\\n\\nChristopher Robin nodded.\\n\\n\"Then there\\'s only one thing to be done,\" he said. \"We shall have to\\nwait for you to get thin again.\"\\n\\n\"How long does getting thin take?\" asked Pooh anxiously.\\n\\n\"About a week, I should think.\"\\n\\n\"But I can\\'t stay here for a _week_!\"\\n\\n\"You can _stay_ here all right, silly old Bear. It\\'s getting you out\\nwhich is so difficult.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll read to you,\" said Rabbit cheerfully. \"And I hope it won\\'t snow,\"\\nhe added. \"And I say, old fellow, you\\'re taking up a good deal of room\\nin my house--_do_ you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse?\\nBecause, I mean, there they are--doing nothing--and it would be very\\nconvenient just to hang the towels on them.\"\\n\\n\"A week!\" said Pooh gloomily. \"_What about meals?_\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid no meals,\" said Christopher Robin, \"because of getting thin\\nquicker. But we _will_ read to you.\"\\n\\nBear began to sigh, and then found he couldn\\'t because he was so tightly\\nstuck; and a tear rolled down his eye, as he said:\\n\\n\"Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a\\nWedged Bear in Great Tightness?\"\\n\\nSo for a week Christopher Robin read that sort of book at the North end\\nof Pooh, and Rabbit hung his washing on the South end ... and in\\nbetween Bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer. And at the\\nend of the week Christopher Robin said, \"_Now!_\"\\n\\nSo he took hold of Pooh\\'s front paws and Rabbit took hold of Christopher\\nRobin, and all Rabbit\\'s friends and relations took hold of Rabbit, and\\nthey all pulled together....\\n\\nAnd for a long time Pooh only said \"_Ow!_\" ...\\n\\nAnd \"_Oh!_\" ...\\n\\nAnd then, all of a sudden, he said \"_Pop!_\" just as if a cork were\\ncoming out of a bottle.\\n\\nAnd Christopher Robin and Rabbit and all Rabbit\\'s friends and relations\\nwent head-over-heels backwards ... and on the top of them came\\nWinnie-the-Pooh--free!\\n\\nSo, with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk\\nthrough the forest, humming proudly to himself. But, Christopher Robin\\nlooked after him lovingly, and said to himself, \"Silly old Bear!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER III\\n\\n                   IN WHICH POOH AND PIGLET GO HUNTING\\n                        AND NEARLY CATCH A WOOZLE\\n\\n\\nThe Piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beech-tree,\\nand the beech-tree was in the middle of the forest, and the Piglet lived\\nin the middle of the house. Next to his house was a piece of broken\\nboard which had: \"TRESPASSERS W\" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the\\nPiglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather\\'s name, and had\\nbeen in the family for a long time, Christopher Robin said you\\n_couldn\\'t_ be called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could,\\nbecause his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will,\\nwhich was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two\\nnames in case he lost one--Trespassers after an uncle, and William after\\nTrespassers.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got two names,\" said Christopher Robin carelessly.\\n\\n\"Well, there you are, that proves it,\" said Piglet.\\n\\nOne fine winter\\'s day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of\\nhis house, he happened to look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh\\nwas walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something else, and\\nwhen Piglet called to him, he just went on walking.\\n\\n\"Hallo!\" said Piglet, \"what are _you_ doing?\"\\n\\n\"Hunting,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Hunting what?\"\\n\\n\"Tracking something,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh very mysteriously.\\n\\n\"Tracking what?\" said Piglet, coming closer.\\n\\n\"That\\'s just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?\"\\n\\n\"What do you think you\\'ll answer?\"\\n\\n\"I shall have to wait until I catch up with it,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\"Now, look there.\" He pointed to the ground in front of him. \"What do\\nyou see there?\"\\n\\n\"Tracks,\" said Piglet. \"Paw-marks.\" He gave a little squeak of\\nexcitement. \"Oh, Pooh! Do you think it\\'s a--a--a Woozle?\"\\n\\n\"It may be,\" said Pooh. \"Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn\\'t. You\\nnever can tell with paw-marks.\"\\n\\nWith these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him\\nfor a minute or two, ran after him. Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden\\nstop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Piglet.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a very funny thing,\" said Bear, \"but there seem to be\\n_two_ animals now. This--whatever-it-was--has been joined by\\nanother--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now proceeding\\nin company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they\\nturn out to be Hostile Animals?\"\\n\\nPiglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had\\nnothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it\\nreally _was_ a Woozle.\\n\\n\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and\\nPiglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they\\nwent together.\\n\\nThere was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if\\nthe two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this\\nspinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet\\npassing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had\\ndone to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather\\nTrespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,\\nand other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was\\nlike, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and,\\nif so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and\\nwhat Christopher Robin would say. And still the tracks went on in front\\nof them....\\n\\nSuddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him.\\n\"_Look!_\"\\n\\n\"_What?_\" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn\\'t\\nbeen frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an\\nexercising sort of way.\\n\\n\"The tracks!\" said Pooh. \"_A third animal has joined the other two!_\"\\n\\n\"Pooh!\" cried Piglet. \"Do you think it is another Woozle?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Pooh, \"because it makes different marks. It is either Two\\nWoozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles\\nand one, if so it is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them.\"\\n\\nSo they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three\\nanimals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very\\nmuch that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and\\nPooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly\\nbut quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so\\nmuch. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and\\nlicked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more\\nhot and anxious than ever in his life before. _There were four animals\\nin front of them!_\\n\\n\"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles,\\nand one, as it was, Wizzle. _Another Woozle has joined them!_\"\\n\\nAnd so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other\\nhere, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every\\nnow and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.\\n\\n\"I _think_,\" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too,\\nand found that it brought very little comfort, \"I _think_ that I have\\njust remembered something. I have just remembered something that I\\nforgot to do yesterday and shan\\'t be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose\\nI really ought to go back and do it now.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll do it this afternoon, and I\\'ll come with you,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,\" said Piglet\\nquickly. \"It\\'s a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in\\nthe morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you\\nsay the time was?\"\\n\\n\"About twelve,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun.\\n\\n\"Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So,\\nreally, dear old Pooh, if you\\'ll excuse me----_What\\'s that?_\"\\n\\nPooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he\\nlooked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend\\nof his.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Christopher Robin,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Ah, then you\\'ll be all right,\" said Piglet. \"You\\'ll be quite safe with\\n_him_. Good-bye,\" and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very\\nglad to be Out of All Danger again.\\n\\nChristopher Robin came slowly down his tree.\\n\\n\"Silly old Bear,\" he said, \"what _were_ you doing? First you went round\\nthe spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you\\nwent round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth\\ntime----\"\\n\\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw.\\n\\nHe sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then\\nhe fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his\\nnose twice, and stood up.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\n\"I see now,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\n\"I have been Foolish and Deluded,\" said he, \"and I am a Bear of No Brain\\nat All.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re the Best Bear in All the World,\" said Christopher Robin\\nsoothingly.\\n\\n\"Am I?\" said Pooh hopefully. And then he brightened up suddenly.\\n\\n\"Anyhow,\" he said, \"it is nearly Luncheon Time.\"\\n\\nSo he went home for it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER IV\\n\\n                      IN WHICH EEYORE LOSES A TAIL\\n                           AND POOH FINDS ONE\\n\\n\\nThe Old Grey Donkey, Eeyore, stood by himself in a thistly corner of\\nthe forest, his front feet well apart, his head on one side, and thought\\nabout things. Sometimes he thought sadly to himself, \"Why?\" and\\nsometimes he thought, \"Wherefore?\" and sometimes he thought, \"Inasmuch\\nas which?\"--and sometimes he didn\\'t quite know what he _was_ thinking\\nabout. So when Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very glad\\nto be able to stop thinking for a little, in order to say \"How do you\\ndo?\" in a gloomy manner to him.\\n\\n\"And how are you?\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\nEeyore shook his head from side to side.\\n\\n\"Not very how,\" he said. \"I don\\'t seem to have felt at all how for a\\nlong time.\"\\n\\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, \"I\\'m sorry about that. Let\\'s have a look at\\nyou.\"\\n\\nSo Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh\\nwalked all round him once.\\n\\n\"Why, what\\'s happened to your tail?\" he said in surprise.\\n\\n\"What _has_ happened to it?\" said Eeyore.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t there!\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n\"Well, either a tail _is_ there or it isn\\'t there. You can\\'t make a\\nmistake about it. And yours _isn\\'t_ there!\"\\n\\n\"Then what is?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s have a look,\" said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the\\nplace where his tail had been a little while ago, and then, finding that\\nhe couldn\\'t catch it up, he turned round the other way, until he came\\nback to where he was at first, and then he put his head down and looked\\nbetween his front legs, and at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, \"I\\nbelieve you\\'re right.\"\\n\\n\"Of course I\\'m right,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"That Accounts for a Good Deal,\" said Eeyore gloomily. \"It Explains\\nEverything. No Wonder.\"\\n\\n\"You must have left it somewhere,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\\n\\n\"Somebody must have taken it,\" said Eeyore. \"How Like Them,\" he added,\\nafter a long silence.\\n\\nPooh felt that he ought to say something helpful about it, but didn\\'t\\nquite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.\\n\\n\"Eeyore,\" he said solemnly, \"I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Pooh,\" answered Eeyore. \"You\\'re a real friend,\" said he.\\n\"Not like Some,\" he said.\\n\\nSo Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore\\'s tail.\\n\\nIt was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little\\nsoft clouds played happily in a blue sky, skipping from time to time in\\nfront of the sun as if they had come to put it out, and then sliding\\naway suddenly so that the next might have his turn. Through them and\\nbetween them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs\\nall the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace\\nwhich the beeches had put on so prettily. Through copse and spinney\\nmarched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of\\nstreams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at\\nlast, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the\\nHundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.\\n\\n\"And if anyone knows anything about anything,\" said Bear to himself,\\n\"it\\'s Owl who knows something about something,\" he said, \"or my name\\'s\\nnot Winnie-the-Pooh,\" he said. \"Which it is,\" he added. \"So there you\\nare.\"\\n\\nOwl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world residence of great charm, which\\nwas grander than anybody else\\'s, or seemed so to Bear, because it had\\nboth a knocker _and_ a bell-pull. Underneath the knocker there was a\\nnotice which said:\\n\\n                   PLES RING IF AN RNSER IS REQIRD.\\n\\nUnderneath the bell-pull there was a notice which said:\\n\\n                  PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID.\\n\\nThese notices had been written by Christopher Robin, who was the only\\none in the forest who could spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many\\nways, able to read and write and spell his own name WOL, yet somehow\\nwent all to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTEREDTOAST.\\n\\nWinnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very carefully, first from left to\\nright, and afterwards, in case he had missed some of it, from right to\\nleft. Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and\\nhe pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and he called out in a very loud\\nvoice, \"Owl! I require an answer! It\\'s Bear speaking.\" And the door\\nopened, and Owl looked out.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" he said. \"How\\'s things?\"\\n\\n\"Terrible and Sad,\" said Pooh, \"because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine,\\nhas lost his tail. And he\\'s Moping about it. So could you very kindly\\ntell me how to find it for him?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Owl, \"the customary procedure in such cases is as follows.\"\\n\\n\"What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?\" said Pooh. \"For I am a Bear of\\nVery Little Brain, and long words Bother me.\"\\n\\n\"It means the Thing to Do.\"\\n\\n\"As long as it means that, I don\\'t mind,\" said Pooh humbly.\\n\\n\"The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then----\"\\n\\n\"Just a moment,\" said Pooh, holding up his paw. \"_What_ do we do to\\nthis--what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"I _didn\\'t_ sneeze.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you did, Owl.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me, Pooh, I didn\\'t. You can\\'t sneeze without knowing it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you can\\'t know it without something having been sneezed.\"\\n\\n\"What I _said_ was, \\'First _Issue_ a Reward\\'.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re doing it again,\" said Pooh sadly.\\n\\n\"A Reward!\" said Owl very loudly. \"We write a notice to say that we will\\ngive a large something to anybody who finds Eeyore\\'s tail.\"\\n\\n\"I see, I see,\" said Pooh, nodding his head. \"Talking about large\\nsomethings,\" he went on dreamily, \"I generally have a small something\\nabout now--about this time in the morning,\" and he looked wistfully at\\nthe cupboard in the corner of Owl\\'s parlour; \"just a mouthful of\\ncondensed milk or whatnot, with perhaps a lick of honey----\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" said Owl, \"we write out this notice, and we put it up all\\nover the forest.\"\\n\\n\"A lick of honey,\" murmured Bear to himself, \"or--or not, as the case\\nmay be.\" And he gave a deep sigh, and tried very hard to listen to what\\nOwl was saying.\\n\\nBut Owl went on and on, using longer and longer words, until at last he\\ncame back to where he started, and he explained that the person to write\\nout this notice was Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"It was he who wrote the ones on my front door for me. Did you see them,\\nPooh?\"\\n\\nFor some time now Pooh had been saying \"Yes\" and \"No\" in turn, with his\\neyes shut, to all that Owl was saying, and having said, \"Yes, yes,\" last\\ntime, he said \"No, not at all,\" now, without really knowing what Owl was\\ntalking about.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you see them?\" said Owl, a little surprised. \"Come and look at\\nthem now.\"\\n\\nSo they went outside. And Pooh looked at the knocker and the notice\\nbelow it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and\\nthe more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen\\nsomething like it, somewhere else, sometime before.\\n\\n\"Handsome bell-rope, isn\\'t it?\" said Owl.\\n\\nPooh nodded.\\n\\n\"It reminds me of something,\" he said, \"but I can\\'t think what. Where\\ndid you get it?\"\\n\\n\"I just came across it in the Forest. It was hanging over a bush, and I\\nthought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing\\nhappened, and then I rang it again very loudly, and it came off in my\\nhand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and----\"\\n\\n\"Owl,\" said Pooh solemnly, \"you made a mistake. Somebody did want it.\"\\n\\n\"Who?\"\\n\\n\"Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore. He was--he was fond of it.\"\\n\\n\"Fond of it?\"\\n\\n\"Attached to it,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh sadly.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nSo with these words he unhooked it, and carried it back to Eeyore; and\\nwhen Christopher Robin had nailed it on in its right place again, Eeyore\\nfrisked about the forest, waving his tail so happily that\\nWinnie-the-Pooh came over all funny, and had to hurry home for a little\\nsnack of something to sustain him. And, wiping his mouth half an hour\\nafterwards, he sang to himself proudly:\\n\\n    _Who found the Tail?_\\n      \"I,\" said Pooh,\\n    \"At a quarter to two\\n      (Only it was quarter to eleven really),\\n    _I_ found the Tail!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER V\\n\\n                    IN WHICH PIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\\n\\n\\nOne day, when Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet were\\nall talking together, Christopher Robin finished the mouthful he was\\neating and said carelessly: \"I saw a Heffalump to-day, Piglet.\"\\n\\n\"What was it doing?\" asked Piglet.\\n\\n\"Just lumping along,\" said Christopher Robin. \"I don\\'t think it saw\\n_me_.\"\\n\\n\"I saw one once,\" said Piglet. \"At least, I think I did,\" he said. \"Only\\nperhaps it wasn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"So did I,\" said Pooh, wondering what a Heffalump was like.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t often see them,\" said Christopher Robin carelessly.\\n\\n\"Not now,\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"Not at this time of year,\" said Pooh.\\n\\nThen they all talked about something else, until it was time for Pooh\\nand Piglet to go home together. At first as they stumped along the path\\nwhich edged the Hundred Acre Wood, they didn\\'t say much to each other;\\nbut when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the\\nstepping stones, and were able to walk side by side again over the\\nheather, they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that, and\\nPiglet said, \"If you see what I mean, Pooh,\" and Pooh said, \"It\\'s just\\nwhat I think myself, Piglet,\" and Piglet said, \"But, on the other hand,\\nPooh, we must remember,\" and Pooh said, \"Quite true, Piglet, although I\\nhad forgotten it for the moment.\" And then, just as they came to the Six\\nPine Trees, Pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening, and\\nsaid in a very solemn voice:\\n\\n\"Piglet, I have decided something.\"\\n\\n\"What have you decided, Pooh?\"\\n\\n\"I have decided to catch a Heffalump.\"\\n\\nPooh nodded his head several times as he said this, and waited for\\nPiglet to say \"How?\" or \"Pooh, you couldn\\'t!\" or something helpful of\\nthat sort, but Piglet said nothing. The fact was Piglet was wishing that\\n_he_ had thought about it first.\\n\\n\"I shall do it,\" said Pooh, after waiting a little longer, \"by means of\\na trap. And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me,\\nPiglet.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh,\" said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, \"I will.\" And then\\nhe said, \"How shall we do it?\" and Pooh said, \"That\\'s just it. How?\" And\\nthen they sat down together to think it out.\\n\\nPooh\\'s first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the\\nHeffalump would come along and fall into the Pit, and----\\n\\n\"Why?\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"Why what?\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Why would he fall in?\"\\n\\nPooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be\\nwalking along, humming a little song, and looking up at the sky,\\nwondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn\\'t see the Very Deep Pit\\nuntil he was half-way down, when it would be too late.\\n\\nPiglet said that this was a very good Trap, but supposing it were\\nraining already?\\n\\nPooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he hadn\\'t thought of that. And\\nthen he brightened up, and said that, if it were raining already, the\\nHeffalump would be looking at the sky wondering if it would _clear up_,\\nand so he wouldn\\'t see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way\\ndown.... When it would be too late.\\n\\nPiglet said that, now that this point had been explained, he thought it\\nwas a Cunning Trap.\\n\\nPooh was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump\\nwas as good as caught already, but there was just one other thing which\\nhad to be thought about, and it was this. _Where should they dig the\\nVery Deep Pit?_\\n\\nPiglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a Heffalump\\nwas, just before he fell into it, only about a foot farther on.\\n\\n\"But then he would see us digging it,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Not if he was looking at the sky.\"\\n\\n\"He would Suspect,\" said Pooh, \"if he happened to look down.\" He thought\\nfor a long time and then added sadly, \"It isn\\'t as easy as I thought. I\\nsuppose that\\'s why Heffalumps hardly _ever_ get caught.\"\\n\\n\"That must be it,\" said Piglet.\\n\\nThey sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out\\nof themselves they sat down again; and all the time Pooh was saying to\\nhimself, \"If only I could _think_ of something!\" For he felt sure that a\\nVery Clever Brain could catch a Heffalump if only he knew the right way\\nto go about it.\\n\\n\"Suppose,\" he said to Piglet, \"_you_ wanted to catch _me_, how would you\\ndo it?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Piglet, \"I should do it like this. I should make a Trap,\\nand I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and\\nyou would go in after it, and----\"\\n\\n\"And I would go in after it,\" said Pooh excitedly, \"only very carefully\\nso as not to hurt myself, and I would get to the Jar of Honey, and I\\nshould lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn\\'t\\nany more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a\\nlittle, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of\\nthe jar, and then----\"\\n\\n\"Yes, well never mind about that. There you would be, and there I should\\ncatch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like?\\nI should think acorns, shouldn\\'t you? We\\'ll get a lot of----I say, wake\\nup, Pooh!\"\\n\\nPooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said\\nthat Honey was a much more trappy thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn\\'t\\nthink so; and they were just going to argue about it, when Piglet\\nremembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, _he_ would have to find\\nthe acorns, but if they put honey, then Pooh would have to give up some\\nof his own honey, so he said, \"All right, honey then,\" just as Pooh\\nremembered it too, and was going to say, \"All right, haycorns.\"\\n\\n\"Honey,\" said Piglet to himself in a thoughtful way, as if it were now\\nsettled. \"_I\\'ll_ dig the pit, while _you_ go and get the honey.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Pooh, and he stumped off.\\n\\nAs soon as he got home, he went to the larder; and he stood on a chair,\\nand took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY\\nwritten on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and\\nlooked at it, and it _looked_ just like honey. \"But you never can tell,\"\\nsaid Pooh. \"I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just\\nthis colour.\" So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick. \"Yes,\" he\\nsaid, \"it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say, right down\\nto the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,\" he said, \"somebody put\\ncheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a\\n_little_ further ... just in case ... in case Heffalumps _don\\'t_\\nlike cheese ... same as me.... Ah!\" And he gave a deep sigh. \"I\\n_was_ right. It _is_ honey, right the way down.\"\\n\\nHaving made certain of this, he took the jar back to Piglet, and Piglet\\nlooked up from the bottom of his Very Deep Pit, and said, \"Got it?\" and\\nPooh said, \"Yes, but it isn\\'t quite a full jar,\" and he threw it down to\\nPiglet, and Piglet said, \"No, it isn\\'t! Is that all you\\'ve got left?\"\\nand Pooh said \"Yes.\" Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at the bottom\\nof the Pit, and climbed out, and they went off home together.\\n\\n\"Well, good night, Pooh,\" said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh\\'s\\nhouse. \"And we meet at six o\\'clock to-morrow morning by the Pine Trees,\\nand see how many Heffalumps we\\'ve got in our Trap.\"\\n\\n\"Six o\\'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?\"\\n\\n\"No. Why do you want string?\"\\n\\n\"To lead them home with.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! ... I _think_ Heffalumps come if you whistle.\"\\n\\n\"Some do and some don\\'t. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good\\nnight!\"\\n\\n\"Good night!\"\\n\\nAnd off Piglet trotted to his house TRESPASSERS W, while Pooh made his\\npreparations for bed.\\n\\nSome hours later, just as the night was beginning to steal away, Pooh\\nwoke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling\\nbefore, and he knew what it meant. _He was hungry._ So he went to the\\nlarder, and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf, and\\nfound--nothing.\\n\\n\"That\\'s funny,\" he thought. \"I know I had a jar of honey there. A full\\njar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it,\\nso that I should know it was honey. That\\'s very funny.\" And then he\\nbegan to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a\\nmurmur to himself. Like this:\\n\\n    It\\'s very, very funny,\\n    \\'Cos I _know_ I had some honey;\\n    \\'Cos it had a label on,\\n            Saying HUNNY.\\n    A goloptious full-up pot too,\\n    And I don\\'t know where it\\'s got to,\\n    No, I don\\'t know where it\\'s gone--\\n            Well, it\\'s funny.\\n\\nHe had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way,\\nwhen suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to\\ncatch the Heffalump.\\n\\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps.\"\\nAnd he got back into bed.\\n\\nBut he couldn\\'t sleep. The more he tried to sleep, the more he couldn\\'t.\\nHe tried Counting Sheep, which is sometimes a good way of getting to\\nsleep, and, as that was no good, he tried counting Heffalumps. And that\\nwas worse. Because every Heffalump that he counted was making straight\\nfor a pot of Pooh\\'s honey, _and eating it all_. For some minutes he lay\\nthere miserably, but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump\\nwas licking its jaws, and saying to itself, \"Very good honey this, I\\ndon\\'t know when I\\'ve tasted better,\" Pooh could bear it no longer. He\\njumped out of bed, he ran out of the house, and he ran straight to the\\nSix Pine Trees.\\n\\nThe Sun was still in bed, but there was a lightness in the sky over the\\nHundred Acre Wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would\\nsoon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-light the Pine Trees looked\\ncold and lonely, and the Very Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was, and\\nPooh\\'s jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and\\nno more. But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed\\nhoney, and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth, ready\\nfor it.\\n\\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the jar. \"A Heffalump has\\nbeen eating it!\" And then he thought a little and said, \"Oh, no, _I_\\ndid. I forgot.\"\\n\\nIndeed, he had eaten most of it. But there was a little left at the very\\nbottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to\\nlick....\\n\\nBy and by Piglet woke up. As soon as he woke he said to himself, \"Oh!\"\\nThen he said bravely, \"Yes,\" and then, still more bravely, \"Quite so.\"\\nBut he didn\\'t feel very brave, for the word which was really jiggeting\\nabout in his brain was \"Heffalumps.\"\\n\\nWhat was a Heffalump like?\\n\\nWas it Fierce?\\n\\n_Did_ it come when you whistled? And _how_ did it come?\\n\\nWas it Fond of Pigs at all?\\n\\nIf it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any difference _what sort of Pig_?\\n\\nSupposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make any difference _if the\\nPig had a grandfather called TRESPASSERS WILLIAM_?\\n\\nHe didn\\'t know the answer to any of these questions ... and he was\\ngoing to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now!\\n\\nOf course Pooh would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with\\ntwo. But suppose Heffalumps were Very Fierce with Pigs _and_ Bears?\\nWouldn\\'t it be better to pretend that he had a headache, and couldn\\'t go\\nup to the Six Pine Trees this morning? But then suppose that it was a\\nvery fine day, and there was no Heffalump in the trap, here he would be,\\nin bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing. What should\\nhe do?\\n\\nAnd then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six\\nPine Trees now, peep very cautiously into the Trap, and see if there\\n_was_ a Heffalump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and\\nif there wasn\\'t, he wouldn\\'t.\\n\\nSo off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn\\'t be a Heffalump\\nin the Trap, and then he thought that there would, and as he got nearer\\nhe was _sure_ that there would, because he could hear it heffalumping\\nabout it like anything.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!\" said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to\\nrun away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see\\nwhat a Heffalump was like. So he crept to the side of the Trap and\\nlooked in....\\n\\nAnd all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar\\noff his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck.\\n\\n\"_Bother!_\" he said, inside the jar, and \"_Oh, help!_\" and, mostly,\\n\"_Ow!_\" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn\\'t see\\nwhat he was bumping it against, it didn\\'t help him; and he tried to\\nclimb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much\\nof that, he couldn\\'t find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar\\nand all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair ... and\\nit was at that moment that Piglet looked down.\\n\\n\"Help, help!\" cried Piglet, \"a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!\" and he\\nscampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, \"Help, help, a\\nHerrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a\\nHoffable Hellerump!\" And he didn\\'t stop crying and scampering until he\\ngot to Christopher Robin\\'s house.\\n\\n\"Whatever\\'s the matter, Piglet?\" said Christopher Robin, who was just\\ngetting up.\\n\\n\"Heff,\" said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak, \"a\\nHeff--a Heff--a Heffalump.\"\\n\\n\"Where?\"\\n\\n\"Up there,\" said Piglet, waving his paw.\\n\\n\"What did it look like?\"\\n\\n\"Like--like----It had the biggest head you ever saw, Christopher Robin.\\nA great enormous thing, like--like nothing. A huge big--well, like a--I\\ndon\\'t know--like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Christopher Robin, putting on his shoes, \"I shall go and\\nlook at it. Come on.\"\\n\\nPiglet wasn\\'t afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so off they\\nwent....\\n\\n\"I can hear it, can\\'t you?\" said Piglet anxiously, as they got near.\\n\\n\"I can hear _something_,\" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\nIt was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found.\\n\\n\"There!\" said Piglet. \"Isn\\'t it _awful_?\" And he held on tight to\\nChristopher Robin\\'s hand.\\n\\nSuddenly Christopher Robin began to laugh ... and he laughed ... and he\\nlaughed ... and he laughed. And while he was still laughing--_Crash_\\nwent the Heffalump\\'s head against the tree-root, Smash went the jar,\\nand out came Pooh\\'s head again....\\n\\nThen Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had been, and he was so ashamed\\nof himself that he ran straight off home and went to bed with a\\nheadache. But Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to breakfast\\ntogether.\\n\\n\"Oh, Bear!\" said Christopher Robin. \"How I do love you!\"\\n\\n\"So do I,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER VI\\n\\n                     IN WHICH EEYORE HAS A BIRTHDAY\\n                          AND GETS TWO PRESENTS\\n\\n\\nEeyore, the old grey Donkey, stood by the side of the stream, and\\nlooked at himself in the water.\\n\\n\"Pathetic,\" he said. \"That\\'s what it is. Pathetic.\"\\n\\nHe turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards, splashed\\nacross it, and walked slowly back on the other side. Then he looked at\\nhimself in the water again.\\n\\n\"As I thought,\" he said. \"No better from _this_ side. But nobody minds.\\nNobody cares. Pathetic, that\\'s what it is.\"\\n\\nThere was a crackling noise in the bracken behind him, and out came\\nPooh.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Eeyore,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Pooh Bear,\" said Eeyore gloomily. \"If it _is_ a good\\nmorning,\" he said. \"Which I doubt,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Why, what\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can\\'t all, and some of us don\\'t. That\\'s\\nall there is to it.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t all _what_?\" said Pooh, rubbing his nose.\\n\\n\"Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round the mulberry bush.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. He thought for a long time, and then asked, \"What\\nmulberry bush is that?\"\\n\\n\"Bon-hommy,\" went on Eeyore gloomily. \"French word meaning bonhommy,\" he\\nexplained. \"I\\'m not complaining, but There It Is.\"\\n\\nPooh sat down on a large stone, and tried to think this out. It sounded\\nto him like a riddle, and he was never much good at riddles, being a\\nBear of Very Little Brain. So he sang _Cottleston Pie_ instead:\\n\\n    Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,\\n    A fly can\\'t bird, but a bird can fly.\\n    Ask me a riddle and I reply:\\n    \"_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie._\"\\n\\nThat was the first verse. When he had finished it, Eeyore didn\\'t\\nactually say that he didn\\'t like it, so Pooh very kindly sang the second\\nverse to him:\\n\\n    Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,\\n    A fish can\\'t whistle and neither can I.\\n    Ask me a riddle and I reply:\\n    \"_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie_.\"\\n\\nEeyore still said nothing at all, so Pooh hummed the third verse quietly\\nto himself:\\n\\n    Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,\\n    Why does a chicken, I don\\'t know why.\\n    Ask me a riddle and I reply:\\n    \"_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie_.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" said Eeyore. \"Sing. Umty-tiddly, umty-too. Here we go\\ngathering Nuts and May. Enjoy yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Some can,\" said Eeyore.\\n\\n\"Why, what\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\"_Is_ anything the matter?\"\\n\\n\"You seem so sad, Eeyore.\"\\n\\n\"Sad? Why should I be sad? It\\'s my birthday. The happiest day of the\\nyear.\"\\n\\n\"Your birthday?\" said Pooh in great surprise.\\n\\n\"Of course it is. Can\\'t you see? Look at all the presents I have had.\"\\nHe waved a foot from side to side. \"Look at the birthday cake. Candles\\nand pink sugar.\"\\n\\nPooh looked--first to the right and then to the left.\\n\\n\"Presents?\" said Pooh. \"Birthday cake?\" said Pooh. \"_Where?_\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you see them?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Neither can I,\" said Eeyore. \"Joke,\" he explained. \"Ha ha!\"\\n\\nPooh scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this.\\n\\n\"But is it really your birthday?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"It is.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day, Eeyore.\"\\n\\n\"And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear.\"\\n\\n\"But it isn\\'t _my_ birthday.\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s mine.\"\\n\\n\"But you said \\'Many happy returns\\'----\"\\n\\n\"Well, why not? You don\\'t always want to be miserable on my birthday, do\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"It\\'s bad enough,\" said Eeyore, almost breaking down, \"being miserable\\nmyself, what with no presents and no cake and no candles, and no proper\\nnotice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is going to be\\nmiserable too----\"\\n\\nThis was too much for Pooh. \"Stay there!\" he called to Eeyore, as he\\nturned and hurried back home as quick as he could; for he felt that he\\nmust get poor Eeyore a present of _some_ sort at once, and he could\\nalways think of a proper one afterwards.\\n\\nOutside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and down trying to reach\\nthe knocker.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Piglet,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"What are _you_ trying to do?\"\\n\\n\"I was trying to reach the knocker,\" said Piglet. \"I just came\\nround----\"\\n\\n\"Let me do it for you,\" said Pooh kindly. So he reached up and knocked\\nat the door. \"I have just seen Eeyore,\" he began, \"and poor Eeyore is in\\na Very Sad Condition, because it\\'s his birthday, and nobody has taken\\nany notice of it, and he\\'s very Gloomy--you know what Eeyore is--and\\nthere he was, and----What a long time whoever lives here is answering\\nthis door.\" And he knocked again.\\n\\n\"But Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"it\\'s your own house!\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"So it is,\" he said. \"Well, let\\'s go in.\"\\n\\nSo in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to\\nsee if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it\\ndown.\\n\\n\"I\\'m giving this to Eeyore,\" he explained, \"as a present. What are _you_\\ngoing to give?\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both of us?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan.\"\\n\\n\"All right, then, I\\'ll give him a balloon. I\\'ve got one left from my\\nparty. I\\'ll go and get it now, shall I?\"\\n\\n\"That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to\\ncheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\"\\n\\nSo off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his\\njar of honey.\\n\\nIt was a warm day, and he had a long way to go. He hadn\\'t gone more than\\nhalf-way when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him. It\\nbegan at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the\\nsoles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying,\\n\"Now then, Pooh, time for a little something.\"\\n\\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, \"I didn\\'t know it was as late as that.\" So he\\nsat down and took the top off his jar of honey. \"Lucky I brought this\\nwith me,\" he thought. \"Many a bear going out on a warm day like this\\nwould never have thought of bringing a little something with him.\" And\\nhe began to eat.\\n\\n\"Now let me see,\" he thought, as he took his last lick of the inside of\\nthe jar, \"where was I going? Ah, yes, Eeyore.\" He got up slowly.\\n\\nAnd then, suddenly, he remembered. He had eaten Eeyore\\'s birthday\\npresent!\\n\\n\"_Bother!_\" said Pooh. \"What _shall_ I do? I _must_ give him\\n_something_.\"\\n\\nFor a little while he couldn\\'t think of anything. Then he thought:\\n\"Well, it\\'s a very nice pot, even if there\\'s no honey in it, and if I\\nwashed it clean, and got somebody to write \\'_A Happy Birthday_\\' on it,\\nEeyore could keep things in it, which might be Useful.\" So, as he was\\njust passing the Hundred Acre Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who\\nlived there.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Owl,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Pooh,\" said Owl.\\n\\n\"Many happy returns of Eeyore\\'s birthday,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Oh, is that what it is?\"\\n\\n\"What are you giving him, Owl?\"\\n\\n\"What are _you_ giving him, Pooh?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, and I wanted to ask\\nyou----\"\\n\\n\"Is this it?\" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh\\'s paw.\\n\\n\"Yes, and I wanted to ask you----\"\\n\\n\"Somebody has been keeping honey in it,\" said Owl.\\n\\n\"You can keep _anything_ in it,\" said Pooh earnestly. \"It\\'s Very Useful\\nlike that. And I wanted to ask you----\"\\n\\n\"You ought to write \\'_A Happy Birthday_\\' on it.\"\\n\\n\"_That_ was what I wanted to ask you,\" said Pooh. \"Because my spelling\\nis Wobbly. It\\'s good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the\\nwrong places. Would _you_ write \\'A Happy Birthday\\' on it for me?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a nice pot,\" said Owl, looking at it all round. \"Couldn\\'t I give\\nit too? From both of us?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan. Now I\\'ll just wash it\\nfirst, and then you can write on it.\"\\n\\nWell, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while Owl licked the end of\\nhis pencil, and wondered how to spell \"birthday.\"\\n\\n\"Can you read, Pooh?\" he asked a little anxiously. \"There\\'s a notice\\nabout knocking and ringing outside my door, which Christopher Robin\\nwrote. Could you read it?\"\\n\\n\"Christopher Robin told me what it said, and _then_ I could.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll tell you what _this_ says, and then you\\'ll be able to.\"\\n\\nSo Owl wrote ... and this is what he wrote:\\n\\n                 HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY.\\n\\nPooh looked on admiringly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m just saying \\'A Happy Birthday\\',\" said Owl carelessly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a nice long one,\" said Pooh, very much impressed by it.\\n\\n\"Well, _actually_, of course, I\\'m saying \\'A Very Happy Birthday with\\nlove from Pooh.\\' Naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long\\nthing like that.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\\n\\nWhile all this was happening, Piglet had gone back to his own house to\\nget Eeyore\\'s balloon. He held it very tightly against himself, so that\\nit shouldn\\'t blow away, and he ran as fast as he could so as to get to\\nEeyore before Pooh did; for he thought that he would like to be the\\nfirst one to give a present, just as if he had thought of it without\\nbeing told by anybody. And running along, and thinking how pleased\\nEeyore would be, he didn\\'t look where he was going ... and suddenly he\\nput his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat on his face.\\n\\nBANG!!!???***!!!\\n\\nPiglet lay there, wondering what had happened. At first he thought that\\nthe whole world had blown up; and then he thought that perhaps only the\\nForest part of it had; and then he thought that perhaps only _he_ had,\\nand he was now alone in the moon or somewhere, and would never see\\nChristopher Robin or Pooh or Eeyore again. And then he thought, \"Well,\\neven if I\\'m in the moon, I needn\\'t be face downwards all the time,\" so\\nhe got cautiously up and looked about him.\\n\\nHe was still in the Forest!\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s funny,\" he thought. \"I wonder what that bang was. I\\ncouldn\\'t have made such a noise just falling down. And where\\'s my\\nballoon? And what\\'s that small piece of damp rag doing?\"\\n\\nIt was the balloon!\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!\" said Piglet \"Oh, dear, oh, dearie, dearie, dear! Well, it\\'s\\ntoo late now. I can\\'t go back, and I haven\\'t another balloon, and\\nperhaps Eeyore doesn\\'t _like_ balloons so _very_ much.\"\\n\\nSo he trotted on, rather sadly now, and down he came to the side of the\\nstream where Eeyore was, and called out to him.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Eeyore,\" shouted Piglet.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Little Piglet,\" said Eeyore. \"If it _is_ a good morning,\"\\nhe said. \"Which I doubt,\" said he. \"Not that it matters,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Many happy returns of the day,\" said Piglet, having now got closer.\\n\\nEeyore stopped looking at himself in the stream, and turned to stare at\\nPiglet.\\n\\n\"Just say that again,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Many hap----\"\\n\\n\"Wait a moment.\"\\n\\nBalancing on three legs, he began to bring his fourth leg very\\ncautiously up to his ear. \"I did this yesterday,\" he explained, as he\\nfell down for the third time. \"It\\'s quite easy. It\\'s so as I can hear\\nbetter.... There, that\\'s done it! Now then, what were you saying?\" He\\npushed his ear forward with his hoof.\\n\\n\"Many happy returns of the day,\" said Piglet again.\\n\\n\"Meaning me?\"\\n\\n\"Of course, Eeyore.\"\\n\\n\"My birthday?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Me having a real birthday?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Eeyore, and I\\'ve brought you a present.\"\\n\\nEeyore took down his right hoof from his right ear, turned round, and\\nwith great difficulty put up his left hoof.\\n\\n\"I must have that in the other ear,\" he said. \"Now then.\"\\n\\n\"A present,\" said Piglet very loudly.\\n\\n\"Meaning me again?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"My birthday still?\"\\n\\n\"Of course, Eeyore.\"\\n\\n\"Me going on having a real birthday?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Eeyore, and I brought you a balloon.\"\\n\\n\"_Balloon?_\" said Eeyore. \"You did say balloon? One of those big\\ncoloured things you blow up? Gaiety, song-and-dance, here we are and\\nthere we are?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I\\'m afraid--I\\'m very sorry, Eeyore--but when I was running\\nalong to bring it you, I fell down.\"\\n\\n\"Dear, dear, how unlucky! You ran too fast, I expect. You didn\\'t hurt\\nyourself, Little Piglet?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I--I--oh, Eeyore, I burst the balloon!\"\\n\\nThere was a very long silence.\\n\\n\"My balloon?\" said Eeyore at last.\\n\\nPiglet nodded.\\n\\n\"My birthday balloon?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Eeyore,\" said Piglet sniffing a little. \"Here it is. With--with\\nmany happy returns of the day.\" And he gave Eeyore the small piece of\\ndamp rag.\\n\\n\"Is this it?\" said Eeyore, a little surprised.\\n\\nPiglet nodded.\\n\\n\"My present?\"\\n\\nPiglet nodded again.\\n\\n\"The balloon?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Piglet,\" said Eeyore. \"You don\\'t mind my asking,\" he went\\non, \"but what colour was this balloon when it--when it _was_ a balloon?\"\\n\\n\"Red.\"\\n\\n\"I just wondered.... Red,\" he murmured to himself. \"My favourite\\ncolour.... How big was it?\"\\n\\n\"About as big as me.\"\\n\\n\"I just wondered.... About as big as Piglet,\" he said to himself\\nsadly. \"My favourite size. Well, well.\"\\n\\nPiglet felt very miserable, and didn\\'t know what to say. He was still\\nopening his mouth to begin something, and then deciding that it wasn\\'t\\nany good saying _that_, when he heard a shout from the other side of the\\nriver, and there was Pooh.\\n\\n\"Many happy returns of the day,\" called out Pooh, forgetting that he had\\nsaid it already.\\n\\n\"Thank you, Pooh, I\\'m having them,\" said Eeyore gloomily.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve brought you a little present,\" said Pooh excitedly.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had it,\" said Eeyore.\\n\\nPooh had now splashed across the stream to Eeyore, and Piglet was\\nsitting a little way off, his head in his paws, snuffling to himself.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a Useful Pot,\" said Pooh. \"Here it is. And it\\'s got \\'A Very Happy\\nBirthday with love from Pooh\\' written on it. That\\'s what all that\\nwriting is. And it\\'s for putting things in. There!\"\\n\\nWhen Eeyore saw the pot, he became quite excited.\\n\\n\"Why!\" he said. \"I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, Eeyore,\" said Pooh. \"Balloons are much too big to go into Pots.\\nWhat you do with a balloon is, you hold the ballon----\"\\n\\n\"Not mine,\" said Eeyore proudly. \"Look, Piglet!\" And as Piglet looked\\nsorrowfully round, Eeyore picked the balloon up with his teeth, and\\nplaced it carefully in the pot; picked it out and put it on the ground;\\nand then picked it up again and put it carefully back.\\n\\n\"So it does!\" said Pooh. \"It goes in!\"\\n\\n\"So it does!\" said Piglet. \"And it comes out!\"\\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t it?\" said Eeyore. \"It goes in and out like anything.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m very glad,\" said Pooh happily, \"that I thought of giving you a\\nUseful Pot to put things in.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m very glad,\" said Piglet happily, \"that I thought of giving you\\nSomething to put in a Useful Pot.\"\\n\\nBut Eeyore wasn\\'t listening. He was taking the balloon out, and putting\\nit back again, as happy as could be....\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"And didn\\'t _I_ give him anything?\" asked Christopher Robin sadly.\\n\\n\"Of course you did,\" I said. \"You gave him--don\\'t you remember--a\\nlittle--a little----\"\\n\\n\"I gave him a box of paints to paint things with.\"\\n\\n\"That was it.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t I give it to him in the morning?\"\\n\\n\"You were so busy getting his party ready for him. He had a cake with\\nicing on the top, and three candles, and his name in pink sugar,\\nand----\"\\n\\n\"Yes, _I_ remember,\" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER VII\\n\\n                    IN WHICH KANGA AND BABY ROO COME\\n                  TO THE FOREST, AND PIGLET HAS A BATH\\n\\n\\nNobody seemed to know where they came from, but there they were in the\\nForest: Kanga and Baby Roo. When Pooh asked Christopher Robin, \"How did\\nthey come here?\" Christopher Robin said, \"In the Usual Way, if you know\\nwhat I mean, Pooh,\" and Pooh, who didn\\'t, said \"Oh!\" Then he nodded his\\nhead twice and said, \"In the Usual Way. Ah!\" Then he went to call upon\\nhis friend Piglet to see what _he_ thought about it. And at Piglet\\'s\\nhouse he found Rabbit. So they all talked about it together.\\n\\n\"What I don\\'t like about it is this,\" said Rabbit. \"Here are we--you,\\nPooh, and you, Piglet, and Me--and suddenly----\"\\n\\n\"And Eeyore,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"And Eeyore--and then suddenly----\"\\n\\n\"And Owl,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"And Owl--and then all of a sudden----\"\\n\\n\"Oh, and Eeyore,\" said Pooh. \"I was forgetting _him_.\"\\n\\n\"Here--we--are,\" said Rabbit very slowly and carefully, \"all--of--us,\\nand then, suddenly, we wake up one morning and, what do we find? We find\\na Strange Animal among us. An animal of whom we have never even heard\\nbefore! An animal who carries her family about with her in her pocket!\\nSuppose _I_ carried _my_ family about with me in _my_ pocket, how many\\npockets should I want?\"\\n\\n\"Sixteen,\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"Seventeen, isn\\'t it?\" said Rabbit. \"And one more for a\\nhandkerchief--that\\'s eighteen. Eighteen pockets in one suit! I haven\\'t\\ntime.\"\\n\\nThere was a long and thoughtful silence ... and then Pooh, who had\\nbeen frowning very hard for some minutes, said: \"_I_ make it fifteen.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Rabbit.\\n\\n\"Fifteen.\"\\n\\n\"Fifteen what?\"\\n\\n\"Your family.\"\\n\\n\"What about them?\"\\n\\nPooh rubbed his nose and said that he thought Rabbit had been talking\\nabout his family.\\n\\n\"Did I?\" said Rabbit carelessly.\\n\\n\"Yes, you said----\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, Pooh,\" said Piglet impatiently.\\n\\n\"The question is, What are we to do about Kanga?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"The best way,\" said Rabbit, \"would be this. The best way would be to\\nsteal Baby Roo and hide him, and then when Kanga says, \\'Where\\'s Baby\\nRoo?\\' we say, \\'_Aha!_\\'\"\\n\\n\"_Aha!_\" said Pooh, practising. \"_Aha! Aha!_ ... Of course,\" he went\\non, \"we could say \\'Aha!\\' even if we hadn\\'t stolen Baby Roo.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh,\" said Rabbit kindly, \"you haven\\'t any brain.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" said Pooh humbly.\\n\\n\"We say \\'_Aha!_\\' so that Kanga knows that _we_ know where Baby Roo is.\\n\\'_Aha!_\\' means \\'We\\'ll tell you where Baby Roo is, if you promise to go\\naway from the Forest and never come back.\\' Now don\\'t talk while I\\nthink.\"\\n\\nPooh went into a corner and tried saying \\'Aha!\\' in that sort of voice.\\nSometimes it seemed to him that it did mean what Rabbit said, and\\nsometimes it seemed to him that it didn\\'t. \"I suppose it\\'s just\\npractice,\" he thought. \"I wonder if Kanga will have to practise too so\\nas to understand it.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s just one thing,\" said Piglet, fidgeting a bit. \"I was talking\\nto Christopher Robin, and he said that a Kanga was Generally Regarded as\\nOne of the Fiercer Animals. I am not frightened of Fierce Animals in the\\nordinary way, but it is well known that, if One of the Fiercer Animals\\nis Deprived of Its Young, it becomes as fierce as Two of the Fiercer\\nAnimals. In which case \\'_Aha!_\\' is perhaps a _foolish_ thing to say.\"\\n\\n\"Piglet,\" said Rabbit, taking out a pencil, and licking the end of it,\\n\"you haven\\'t any pluck.\"\\n\\n\"It is hard to be brave,\" said Piglet, sniffing slightly, \"when you\\'re\\nonly a Very Small Animal.\"\\n\\nRabbit, who had begun to write very busily, looked up and said:\\n\\n\"It is because you are a very small animal that you will be Useful in\\nthe adventure before us.\"\\n\\nPiglet was so excited at the idea of being Useful, that he forgot to be\\nfrightened any more, and when Rabbit went on to say that Kangas were\\nonly Fierce during the winter months, being at other times of an\\nAffectionate Disposition, he could hardly sit still, he was so eager to\\nbegin being useful at once.\\n\\n\"What about me?\" said Pooh sadly. \"I suppose _I_ shan\\'t be useful?\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, Pooh,\" said Piglet comfortingly. \"Another time perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Without Pooh,\" said Rabbit solemnly as he sharpened his pencil, \"the\\nadventure would be impossible.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Piglet, and tried not to look disappointed. But Pooh went\\ninto a corner of the room and said proudly to himself, \"Impossible\\nwithout Me! _That_ sort of Bear.\"\\n\\n\"Now listen all of you,\" said Rabbit when he had finished writing, and\\nPooh and Piglet sat listening very eagerly with their mouths open. This\\nwas what Rabbit read out:\\n\\n                        PLAN TO CAPTURE BABY ROO\\n\\n   1. _General Remarks._ Kanga runs faster than any of Us, even Me.\\n\\n   2. _More General Remarks._ Kanga never takes her eye off Baby Roo,\\n      except when he\\'s safely buttoned up in her pocket.\\n\\n   3. _Therefore._ If we are to capture Baby Roo, we must get a Long\\n      Start, because Kanga runs faster than any of Us, even Me.\\n     (_See_ 1.)\\n\\n   4. _A Thought._ If Roo had jumped out of Kanga\\'s pocket and Piglet\\n      had jumped in, Kanga wouldn\\'t know the difference, because Piglet\\n      is a Very Small Animal.\\n\\n   5. Like Roo.\\n\\n   6. But Kanga would have to be looking the other way first, so as not\\n      to see Piglet jumping in.\\n\\n   7. See 2.\\n\\n   8. _Another Thought._ But if Pooh was talking to her very excitedly,\\n      she _might_ look the other way for a moment.\\n\\n   9. And then I could run away with Roo.\\n\\n   10. Quickly.\\n\\n   11. _And Kanga wouldn\\'t discover the difference until Afterwards._\\n\\nWell, Rabbit read this out proudly, and for a little while after he had\\nread it nobody said anything. And then Piglet, who had been opening and\\nshutting his mouth without making any noise, managed to say very\\nhuskily:\\n\\n\"And--Afterwards?\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"When Kanga _does_ Discover the Difference?\"\\n\\n\"Then we all say \\'_Aha!_\\'\"\\n\\n\"All three of us?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"Why, what\\'s the trouble, Piglet?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" said Piglet, \"as long as _we all three_ say it. As long as we\\nall three say it,\" said Piglet, \"I don\\'t mind,\" he said, \"but I\\nshouldn\\'t care to say \\'_Aha!_\\' by myself. It wouldn\\'t sound _nearly_ so\\nwell. By the way,\" he said, \"you _are_ quite sure about what you said\\nabout the winter months?\"\\n\\n\"The winter months?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, only being Fierce in the Winter Months.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, yes, that\\'s all right. Well, Pooh? You see what you have to\\ndo?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Pooh Bear. \"Not yet,\" he said. \"What _do_ I do?\"\\n\\n\"Well, you just have to talk very hard to Kanga so as she doesn\\'t notice\\nanything.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! What about?\"\\n\\n\"Anything you like.\"\\n\\n\"You mean like telling her a little bit of poetry or something?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Rabbit. \"Splendid. Now come along.\"\\n\\nSo they all went out to look for Kanga.\\n\\nKanga and Roo were spending a quiet afternoon in a sandy part of the\\nForest. Baby Roo was practising very small jumps in the sand, and\\nfalling down mouse-holes and climbing out of them, and Kanga was\\nfidgeting about and saying \"Just one more jump, dear, and then we must\\ngo home.\" And at that moment who should come stumping up the hill but\\nPooh.\\n\\n\"Good afternoon, Kanga.\"\\n\\n\"Good afternoon, Pooh.\"\\n\\n\"Look at me jumping,\" squeaked Roo, and fell into another mouse-hole.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Roo, my little fellow!\"\\n\\n\"We were just going home,\" said Kanga. \"Good afternoon, Rabbit. Good\\nafternoon, Piglet.\"\\n\\nRabbit and Piglet, who had now come up from the other side of the hill,\\nsaid \"Good afternoon,\" and \"Hallo, Roo,\" and Roo asked them to look at\\nhim jumping, so they stayed and looked.\\n\\nAnd Kanga looked too....\\n\\n\"Oh, Kanga,\" said Pooh, after Rabbit had winked at him twice, \"I don\\'t\\nknow if you are interested in Poetry at all?\"\\n\\n\"Hardly at all,\" said Kanga.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Roo, dear, just one more jump and then we must go home.\"\\n\\nThere was a short silence while Roo fell down another mouse-hole.\\n\\n\"Go on,\" said Rabbit in a loud whisper behind his paw.\\n\\n\"Talking of Poetry,\" said Pooh, \"I made up a little piece as I was\\ncoming along. It went like this. Er--now let me see----\"\\n\\n\"Fancy!\" said Kanga. \"Now Roo, dear----\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll like this piece of poetry,\" said Rabbit.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll love it,\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"You must listen very carefully,\" said Rabbit.\\n\\n\"So as not to miss any of it,\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Kanga, but she still looked at Baby Roo.\\n\\n\"_How_ did it go, Pooh?\" said Rabbit.\\n\\nPooh gave a little cough and began.\\n\\n              LINES WRITTEN BY A BEAR OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN\\n\\n    On Monday, when the sun is hot\\n    I wonder to myself a lot:\\n    \"Now is it true, or is it not,\\n    \"That what is which and which is what?\"\\n\\n    On Tuesday, when it hails and snows,\\n    The feeling on me grows and grows\\n    That hardly anybody knows\\n    If those are these or these are those.\\n\\n    On Wednesday, when the sky is blue,\\n    And I have nothing else to do,\\n    I sometimes wonder if it\\'s true\\n    That who is what and what is who.\\n\\n    On Thursday, when it starts to freeze\\n    And hoar-frost twinkles on the trees,\\n    How very readily one sees\\n    That these are whose--but whose are these?\\n\\n    On Friday----\\n\\n\"Yes, it is, isn\\'t it?\" said Kanga, not waiting to hear what happened on\\nFriday. \"Just one more jump, Roo, dear, and then we really _must_ be\\ngoing.\"\\n\\nRabbit gave Pooh a hurrying-up sort of nudge.\\n\\n\"Talking of Poetry,\" said Pooh quickly, \"have you ever noticed that tree\\nright over there?\"\\n\\n\"Where?\" said Kanga. \"Now, Roo----\"\\n\\n\"Right over there,\" said Pooh, pointing behind Kanga\\'s back.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Kanga. \"Now jump in, Roo, dear, and we\\'ll go home.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to look at that tree right over there,\" said Rabbit. \"Shall I\\nlift you in, Roo?\" And he picked up Roo in his paws.\\n\\n\"I can see a bird in it from here,\" said Pooh. \"Or is it a fish?\"\\n\\n\"You ought to see that bird from here,\" said Rabbit. \"Unless it\\'s a\\nfish.\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t a fish, it\\'s a bird,\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"So it is,\" said Rabbit.\\n\\n\"Is it a starling or a blackbird?\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the whole question,\" said Rabbit. \"Is it a blackbird or a\\nstarling?\"\\n\\nAnd then at last Kanga did turn her head to look. And the moment that\\nher head was turned, Rabbit said in a loud voice \"In you go, Roo!\" and\\nin jumped Piglet into Kanga\\'s pocket, and off scampered Rabbit, with Roo\\nin his paws, as fast as he could.\\n\\n\"Why, where\\'s Rabbit?\" said Kanga, turning round again. \"Are you all\\nright, Roo, dear?\"\\n\\nPiglet made a squeaky Roo-noise from the bottom of Kanga\\'s pocket.\\n\\n\"Rabbit had to go away,\" said Pooh. \"I think he thought of something he\\nhad to go and see about suddenly.\"\\n\\n\"And Piglet?\"\\n\\n\"I think Piglet thought of something at the same time. Suddenly.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we must be getting home,\" said Kanga. \"Good-bye, Pooh.\" And in\\nthree large jumps she was gone.\\n\\nPooh looked after her as she went.\\n\\n\"I wish I could jump like that,\" he thought. \"Some can and some can\\'t.\\nThat\\'s how it is.\"\\n\\nBut there were moments when Piglet wished that Kanga couldn\\'t. Often,\\nwhen he had had a long walk home through the Forest, he had wished that\\nhe were a bird; but now he thought jerkily to himself at the bottom of\\nKanga\\'s pocket,\\n\\n        this                              take\\n    \"If      is          shall      really    to\\n                flying I      never              it.\"\\n\\nAnd as he went up in the air he said, \"_Ooooooo!_\" and as he came down\\nhe said, \"_Ow!_\" And he was saying, \"_Ooooooo-ow, Ooooooo-ow,\\nOoooooo-ow_\" all the way to Kanga\\'s house.\\n\\nOf course as soon as Kanga unbuttoned her pocket, she saw what had\\nhappened. Just for a moment, she thought she was frightened, and then\\nshe knew she wasn\\'t; for she felt quite sure that Christopher Robin\\nwould never let any harm happen to Roo. So she said to herself, \"If they\\nare having a joke with me, I will have a joke with them.\"\\n\\n\"Now then, Roo, dear,\" she said, as she took Piglet out of her pocket.\\n\"Bed-time.\"\\n\\n\"_Aha!_\" said Piglet, as well as he could after his Terrifying Journey.\\nBut it wasn\\'t a very good \"_Aha!_\" and Kanga didn\\'t seem to understand\\nwhat it meant.\\n\\n\"Bath first,\" said Kanga in a cheerful voice.\\n\\n\"_Aha!_\" said Piglet again, looking round anxiously for the others. But\\nthe others weren\\'t there. Rabbit was playing with Baby Roo in his own\\nhouse, and feeling more fond of him every minute, and Pooh, who had\\ndecided to be a Kanga, was still at the sandy place on the top of the\\nForest, practising jumps.\\n\\n\"I am not at all sure,\" said Kanga in a thoughtful voice, \"that it\\nwouldn\\'t be a good idea to have a _cold_ bath this evening. Would you\\nlike that, Roo, dear?\"\\n\\nPiglet, who had never been really fond of baths, shuddered a long\\nindignant shudder, and said in as brave a voice as he could:\\n\\n\"Kanga, I see that the time has come to spleak painly.\"\\n\\n\"Funny little Roo,\" said Kanga, as she got the bath-water ready.\\n\\n\"I am _not_ Roo,\" said Piglet loudly. \"I am Piglet!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, dear, yes,\" said Kanga soothingly. \"And imitating Piglet\\'s voice\\ntoo! So clever of him,\" she went on, as she took a large bar of yellow\\nsoap out of the cupboard. \"What _will_ he be doing next?\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you _see_?\" shouted Piglet. \"Haven\\'t you got _eyes_? _Look_ at\\nme!\"\\n\\n\"I _am_ looking, Roo, dear,\" said Kanga rather severely. \"And you know\\nwhat I told you yesterday about making faces. If you go on making faces\\nlike Piglet\\'s, you will grow up to _look_ like Piglet--and _then_ think\\nhow sorry you will be. Now then, into the bath, and don\\'t let me have to\\nspeak to you about it again.\"\\n\\nBefore he knew where he was, Piglet was in the bath, and Kanga was\\nscrubbing him firmly with a large lathery flannel.\\n\\n\"Ow!\" cried Piglet. \"Let me out! I\\'m Piglet!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t open the mouth, dear, or the soap goes in,\" said Kanga. \"There!\\nWhat did I tell you?\"\\n\\n\"You--you--you did it on purpose,\" spluttered Piglet, as soon as he\\ncould speak again ... and then accidentally had another mouthful of\\nlathery flannel.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, dear, don\\'t say anything,\" said Kanga, and in another\\nminute Piglet was out of the bath, and being rubbed dry with a towel.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Kanga, \"there\\'s your medicine, and then bed.\"\\n\\n\"W-w-what medicine?\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"To make you grow big and strong, dear. You don\\'t want to grow up small\\nand weak like Piglet, do you? Well, then!\"\\n\\nAt that moment there was a knock at the door.\\n\\n\"Come in,\" said Kanga, and in came Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"Christopher Robin, Christopher Robin!\" cried Piglet. \"Tell Kanga who I\\nam! She keeps saying I\\'m Roo. I\\'m _not_ Roo, am I?\"\\n\\nChristopher Robin looked at him very carefully, and shook his head.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t be Roo,\" he said, \"because I\\'ve just seen Roo playing in\\nRabbit\\'s house.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Kanga. \"Fancy that! Fancy my making a mistake like that.\"\\n\\n\"There you are!\" said Piglet. \"I told you so. I\\'m Piglet.\"\\n\\nChristopher Robin shook his head again.\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re not Piglet,\" he said. \"I know Piglet well, and he\\'s _quite_\\na different colour.\"\\n\\nPiglet began to say that this was because he had just had a bath, and\\nthen he thought that perhaps he wouldn\\'t say that, and as he opened his\\nmouth to say something else, Kanga slipped the medicine spoon in, and\\nthen patted him on the back and told him that it was really quite a nice\\ntaste when you got used to it.\\n\\n\"I knew it wasn\\'t Piglet,\" said Kanga. \"I wonder who it can be.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s some relation of Pooh\\'s,\" said Christopher Robin. \"What\\nabout a nephew or an uncle or something?\"\\n\\nKanga agreed that this was probably what it was, and said that they\\nwould have to call it by some name.\\n\\n\"I shall call it Pootel,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Henry Pootel for\\nshort.\"\\n\\nAnd just when it was decided, Henry Pootel wriggled out of Kanga\\'s arms\\nand jumped to the ground. To his great joy Christopher Robin had left\\nthe door open. Never had Henry Pootel Piglet run so fast as he ran then,\\nand he didn\\'t stop running until he had got quite close to his house.\\nBut when he was a hundred yards away he stopped running, and rolled the\\nrest of the way home, so as to get his own nice comfortable colour\\nagain....\\n\\nSo Kanga and Roo stayed in the Forest. And every Tuesday Roo spent the\\nday with his great friend Rabbit, and every Tuesday Kanga spent the day\\nwith her great friend Pooh, teaching him to jump, and every Tuesday\\nPiglet spent the day with his great friend Christopher Robin. So they\\nwere all happy again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER VIII\\n\\n                    IN WHICH CHRISTOPHER ROBIN LEADS\\n                     AN EXPOTITION TO THE NORTH POLE\\n\\n\\nOne fine day Pooh had stumped up to the top of the Forest to see if\\nhis friend Christopher Robin was interested in Bears at all. At\\nbreakfast that morning (a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a\\nhoneycomb or two) he had suddenly thought of a new song. It began like\\nthis:\\n\\n    \"_Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear._\"\\n\\nWhen he had got as far as this, he scratched his head, and thought to\\nhimself \"That\\'s a very good start for a song, but what about the second\\nline?\" He tried singing \"Ho,\" two or three times, but it didn\\'t seem to\\nhelp. \"Perhaps it would be better,\" he thought, \"if I sang Hi for the\\nlife of a Bear.\" So he sang it ... but it wasn\\'t. \"Very well, then,\"\\nhe said, \"I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if I sing it\\nvery quickly, I shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines\\nbefore I have time to think of them, and that will be a Good Song. Now\\nthen:\"\\n\\n          Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear!\\n          Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear!\\n    I don\\'t much mind if it rains or snows,\\n    \\'Cos I\\'ve got a lot of honey on my nice new nose,\\n    I don\\'t much care if it snows or thaws,\\n    \\'Cos I\\'ve got a lot of honey on my nice clean paws!\\n          Sing Ho! for a Bear!\\n          Sing Ho! for a Pooh!\\n    And I\\'ll have a little something in an hour or two!\\n\\nHe was so pleased with this song that he sang it all the way to the top\\nof the Forest, \"and if I go on singing it much longer,\" he thought, \"it\\nwill be time for the little something, and then the last line won\\'t be\\ntrue.\" So he turned it into a hum instead.\\n\\nChristopher Robin was sitting outside his door, putting on his Big\\nBoots. As soon as he saw the Big Boots, Pooh knew that an Adventure was\\ngoing to happen, and he brushed the honey off his nose with the back of\\nhis paw, and spruced himself up as well as he could, so as to look Ready\\nfor Anything.\\n\\n\"Good-morning, Christopher Robin,\" he called out.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Pooh Bear. I can\\'t get this boot on.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s bad,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Do you think you could very kindly lean against me, \\'cos I keep pulling\\nso hard that I fall over backwards.\"\\n\\nPooh sat down, dug his feet into the ground, and pushed hard against\\nChristopher Robin\\'s back, and Christopher Robin pushed hard against his,\\nand pulled and pulled at his boot until he had got it on.\\n\\n\"And that\\'s that,\" said Pooh. \"What do we do next?\"\\n\\n\"We are all going on an Expedition,\" said Christopher Robin, as he got\\nup and brushed himself. \"Thank you, Pooh.\"\\n\\n\"Going on an Expotition?\" said Pooh eagerly. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever\\nbeen on one of those. Where are we going to on this Expotition?\"\\n\\n\"Expedition, silly old Bear. It\\'s got an \\'x\\' in it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"I know.\" But he didn\\'t really.\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to discover the North Pole.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh again. \"What _is_ the North Pole?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just a thing you discover,\" said Christopher Robin carelessly, not\\nbeing quite sure himself.\\n\\n\"Oh! I see,\" said Pooh. \"Are bears any good at discovering it?\"\\n\\n\"Of course they are. And Rabbit and Kanga and all of you. It\\'s an\\nExpedition. That\\'s what an Expedition means. A long line of everybody.\\nYou\\'d better tell the others to get ready, while I see if my gun\\'s all\\nright. And we must all bring Provisions.\"\\n\\n\"Bring what?\"\\n\\n\"Things to eat.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh happily. \"I thought you said Provisions. I\\'ll go and\\ntell them.\" And he stumped off.\\n\\nThe first person he met was Rabbit.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Rabbit,\" he said, \"is that you?\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s pretend it isn\\'t,\" said Rabbit, \"and see what happens.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got a message for you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give it to him.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re all going on an Expotition with Christopher Robin!\"\\n\\n\"What is it when we\\'re on it?\"\\n\\n\"A sort of boat, I think,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Oh! that sort.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. And we\\'re going to discover a Pole or something. Or was it a Mole?\\nAnyhow we\\'re going to discover it.\"\\n\\n\"We are, are we?\" said Rabbit.\\n\\n\"Yes. And we\\'ve got to bring Pro--things to eat with us. In case we want\\nto eat them. Now I\\'m going down to Piglet\\'s. Tell Kanga, will you?\"\\n\\nHe left Rabbit and hurried down to Piglet\\'s house. The Piglet was\\nsitting on the ground at the door of his house blowing happily at a\\ndandelion, and wondering whether it would be this year, next year,\\nsometime or never. He had just discovered that it would be never, and\\nwas trying to remember what \"_it_\" was, and hoping it wasn\\'t anything\\nnice, when Pooh came up.\\n\\n\"Oh! Piglet,\" said Pooh excitedly, \"we\\'re going on an Expotition, all of\\nus, with things to eat. To discover something.\"\\n\\n\"To discover what?\" said Piglet anxiously.\\n\\n\"Oh! just something.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing fierce?\"\\n\\n\"Christopher Robin didn\\'t say anything about fierce. He just said it had\\nan \\'x\\'.\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t their necks I mind,\" said Piglet earnestly. \"It\\'s their teeth.\\nBut if Christopher Robin is coming I don\\'t mind anything.\"\\n\\nIn a little while they were all ready at the top of the Forest, and the\\nExpotition started. First came Christopher Robin and Rabbit, then Piglet\\nand Pooh; then Kanga, with Roo in her pocket, and Owl; then Eeyore; and,\\nat the end, in a long line, all Rabbit\\'s friends-and-relations.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t ask them,\" explained Rabbit carelessly. \"They just came. They\\nalways do. They can march at the end, after Eeyore.\"\\n\\n\"What I say,\" said Eeyore, \"is that it\\'s unsettling. I didn\\'t want to\\ncome on this Expo--what Pooh said. I only came to oblige. But here I\\nam; and if I am the end of the Expo--what we\\'re talking about--then\\nlet me _be_ the end. But if, every time I want to sit down for a\\nlittle rest, I have to brush away half a dozen of Rabbit\\'s smaller\\nfriends-and-relations first, then this isn\\'t an Expo--whatever it\\nis--at all, it\\'s simply a Confused Noise. That\\'s what _I_ say.\"\\n\\n\"I see what Eeyore means,\" said Owl. \"If you ask me----\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not asking anybody,\" said Eeyore. \"I\\'m just telling everybody. We\\ncan look for the North Pole, or we can play \\'Here we go gathering Nuts\\nand May\\' with the end part of an ant\\'s nest. It\\'s all the same to me.\"\\n\\nThere was a shout from the top of the line.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" called Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" called Pooh and Piglet.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" called Owl.\\n\\n\"We\\'re starting,\" said Rabbit. \"I must go.\" And he hurried off to the\\nfront of the Expotition with Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Eeyore. \"We\\'re going. Only Don\\'t Blame Me.\"\\n\\nSo off they all went to discover the Pole. And as they walked, they\\nchattered to each other of this and that, all except Pooh, who was\\nmaking up a song.\\n\\n\"This is the first verse,\" he said to Piglet, when he was ready with it.\\n\\n\"First verse of what?\"\\n\\n\"My song.\"\\n\\n\"What song?\"\\n\\n\"This one.\"\\n\\n\"Which one?\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you listen, Piglet, you\\'ll hear it.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know I\\'m not listening?\"\\n\\nPooh couldn\\'t answer that one, so he began to sing.\\n\\n    They all went off to discover the Pole,\\n      Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all;\\n    It\\'s a Thing you Discover, as I\\'ve been tole\\n      By Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all.\\n    Eeyore, Christopher Robin and Pooh\\n    And Rabbit\\'s relations all went too--\\n    And where the Pole was none of them knew....\\n      Sing Hey! for Owl and Rabbit and all!\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Christopher Robin turning round to Pooh, \"we\\'re just coming\\nto a Dangerous Place.\"\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Pooh turning round quickly to Piglet.\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Piglet to Kanga.\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Kanga to Owl, while Roo said \"Hush!\" several times to\\nhimself very quietly.\\n\\n\"Hush!\" said Owl to Eeyore.\\n\\n\"_Hush!_\" said Eeyore in a terrible voice to all Rabbit\\'s\\nfriends-and-relations, and \"Hush!\" they said hastily to each other all\\ndown the line, until it got to the last one of all. And the last and\\nsmallest friend-and-relation was so upset to find that the whole\\nExpotition was saying \"Hush!\" to _him_, that he buried himself head\\ndownwards in a crack in the ground, and stayed there for two days until\\nthe danger was over, and then went home in a great hurry, and lived\\nquietly with his Aunt ever-afterwards. His name was Alexander Beetle.\\n\\nThey had come to a stream which twisted and tumbled between high rocky\\nbanks, and Christopher Robin saw at once how dangerous it was.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just the place,\" he explained, \"for an Ambush.\"\\n\\n\"What sort of bush?\" whispered Pooh to Piglet. \"A gorse-bush?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Pooh,\" said Owl in his superior way, \"don\\'t you know what an\\nAmbush is?\"\\n\\n\"Owl,\" said Piglet, looking round at him severely, \"Pooh\\'s whisper was a\\nperfectly private whisper, and there was no need----\"\\n\\n\"An Ambush,\" said Owl, \"is a sort of Surprise.\"\\n\\n\"So is a gorse-bush sometimes,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"An Ambush, as I was about to explain to Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"is a sort\\nof Surprise.\"\\n\\n\"If people jump out at you suddenly, that\\'s an Ambush,\" said Owl.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an Ambush, Pooh, when people jump at you suddenly,\" explained\\nPiglet.\\n\\nPooh, who now knew what an Ambush was, said that a gorse-bush had sprung\\nat him suddenly one day when he fell off a tree, and he had taken six\\ndays to get all the prickles out of himself.\\n\\n\"We are not _talking_ about gorse-bushes,\" said Owl a little crossly.\\n\\n\"I am,\" said Pooh.\\n\\nThey were climbing very cautiously up the stream now, going from rock to\\nrock, and after they had gone a little way they came to a place where\\nthe banks widened out at each side, so that on each side of the water\\nthere was a level strip of grass on which they could sit down and rest.\\nAs soon as he saw this, Christopher Robin called \"Halt!\" and they all\\nsat down and rested.\\n\\n\"I think,\" said Christopher Robin, \"that we ought to eat all our\\nProvisions now, so that we shan\\'t have so much to carry.\"\\n\\n\"Eat all our what?\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"All that we\\'ve brought,\" said Piglet, getting to work.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a good idea,\" said Pooh, and he got to work too.\\n\\n\"Have you all got something?\" asked Christopher Robin with his mouth\\nfull.\\n\\n\"All except me,\" said Eeyore. \"As Usual.\" He looked round at them in his\\nmelancholy way. \"I suppose none of you are sitting on a thistle by any\\nchance?\"\\n\\n\"I believe I am,\" said Pooh. \"Ow!\" He got up, and looked behind him.\\n\"Yes, I was. I thought so.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Pooh. If you\\'ve quite finished with it.\" He moved across to\\nPooh\\'s place, and began to eat.\\n\\n\"It don\\'t do them any Good, you know, sitting on them,\" he went on, as\\nhe looked up munching. \"Takes all the Life out of them. Remember that\\nanother time, all of you. A little Consideration, a little Thought for\\nOthers, makes all the difference.\"\\n\\nAs soon as he had finished his lunch Christopher Robin whispered to\\nRabbit, and Rabbit said \"Yes, yes, of course,\" and they walked a little\\nway up the stream together.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t want the others to hear,\" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" said Rabbit, looking important.\\n\\n\"It\\'s--I wondered--It\\'s only--Rabbit, I suppose _you_ don\\'t know, What\\ndoes the North Pole _look_ like?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Rabbit, stroking his whiskers. \"Now you\\'re asking me.\"\\n\\n\"I did know once, only I\\'ve sort of forgotten,\" said Christopher Robin\\ncarelessly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a funny thing,\" said Rabbit, \"but I\\'ve sort of forgotten too,\\nalthough I did know _once_.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose it\\'s just a pole stuck in the ground?\"\\n\\n\"Sure to be a pole,\" said Rabbit, \"because of calling it a pole, and if\\nit\\'s a pole, well, I should think it would be sticking in the ground,\\nshouldn\\'t you, because there\\'d be nowhere else to stick it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s what I thought.\"\\n\\n\"The only thing,\" said Rabbit, \"is, _where is it sticking_?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what we\\'re looking for,\" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\nThey went back to the others. Piglet was lying on his back, sleeping\\npeacefully. Roo was washing his face and paws in the stream, while Kanga\\nexplained to everybody proudly that this was the first time he had ever\\nwashed his face himself, and Owl was telling Kanga an Interesting\\nAnecdote full of long words like Encyclopædia and Rhododendron to which\\nKanga wasn\\'t listening.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t hold with all this washing,\" grumbled Eeyore. \"This modern\\nBehind-the-ears nonsense. What do _you_ think, Pooh?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Pooh, \"_I_ think----\"\\n\\nBut we shall never know what Pooh thought, for there came a sudden\\nsqueak from Roo, a splash, and a loud cry of alarm from Kanga.\\n\\n\"So much for _washing_,\" said Eeyore.\\n\\n\"Roo\\'s fallen in!\" cried Rabbit, and he and Christopher Robin came\\nrushing down to the rescue.\\n\\n\"Look at me swimming!\" squeaked Roo from the middle of his pool, and was\\nhurried down a waterfall into the next pool.\\n\\n\"Are you all right, Roo dear?\" called Kanga anxiously.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said Roo. \"Look at me sw----\" and down he went over the next\\nwaterfall into another pool.\\n\\nEverybody was doing something to help. Piglet, wide awake suddenly, was\\njumping up and down and making \"Oo, I say\" noises; Owl was explaining\\nthat in a case of Sudden and Temporary Immersion the Important Thing was\\nto keep the Head Above Water; Kanga was jumping along the bank, saying\\n\"Are you _sure_ you\\'re all right, Roo dear?\" to which Roo, from whatever\\npool he was in at the moment, was answering \"Look at me swimming!\"\\nEeyore had turned round and hung his tail over the first pool into which\\nRoo fell, and with his back to the accident was grumbling quietly to\\nhimself, and saying, \"All this washing; but catch on to my tail, little\\nRoo, and you\\'ll be all right\"; and, Christopher Robin and Rabbit came\\nhurrying past Eeyore, and were calling out to the others in front of\\nthem.\\n\\n\"All right, Roo, I\\'m coming,\" called Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"Get something across the stream lower down, some of you fellows,\"\\ncalled Rabbit.\\n\\nBut Pooh was getting something. Two pools below Roo he was standing with\\na long pole in his paws, and Kanga came up and took one end of it, and\\nbetween them they held it across the lower part of the pool; and Roo,\\nstill bubbling proudly, \"Look at me swimming,\" drifted up against it,\\nand climbed out.\\n\\n\"Did you see me swimming?\" squeaked Roo excitedly, while Kanga scolded\\nhim and rubbed him down. \"Pooh, did you see me swimming? That\\'s called\\nswimming, what I was doing. Rabbit, did you see what I was doing?\\nSwimming. Hallo, Piglet! I say, Piglet! What do you think I was doing!\\nSwimming! Christopher Robin, did you see me----\"\\n\\nBut Christopher Robin wasn\\'t listening. He was looking at Pooh.\\n\\n\"Pooh,\" he said, \"where did you find that pole?\"\\n\\nPooh looked at the pole in his hands.\\n\\n\"I just found it,\" he said. \"I thought it ought to be useful. I just\\npicked it up.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh,\" said Christopher Robin solemnly, \"the Expedition is over. You\\nhave found the North Pole!\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\\n\\nEeyore was sitting with his tail in the water when they all got back to\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Tell Roo to be quick, somebody,\" he said. \"My tail\\'s getting cold. I\\ndon\\'t want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don\\'t want to\\ncomplain but there it is. My tail\\'s cold.\"\\n\\n\"Here I am!\" squeaked Roo.\\n\\n\"Oh, there you are.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see me swimming?\"\\n\\nEeyore took his tail out of the water, and swished it from side to side.\\n\\n\"As I expected,\" he said. \"Lost all feeling. Numbed it. That\\'s what it\\'s\\ndone. Numbed it. Well, as long as nobody minds, I suppose it\\'s all\\nright.\"\\n\\n\"Poor old Eeyore. I\\'ll dry it for you,\" said Christopher Robin, and he\\ntook out his handkerchief and rubbed it up.\\n\\n\"Thank you, Christopher Robin. You\\'re the only one who seems to\\nunderstand about tails. They don\\'t think--that\\'s what the matter with\\nsome of these others. They\\'ve no imagination. A tail isn\\'t a tail to\\n_them_, it\\'s just a Little Bit Extra at the back.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind, Eeyore,\" said Christopher Robin, rubbing his hardest. \"Is\\n_that_ better?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s feeling more like a tail perhaps. It Belongs again, if you know\\nwhat I mean.\"\\n\\n\"Hullo, Eeyore,\" said Pooh, coming up to them with his pole.\\n\\n\"Hullo, Pooh. Thank you for asking, but I shall be able to use it again\\nin a day or two.\"\\n\\n\"Use what?\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"What we are talking about.\"\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t talking about anything,\" said Pooh, looking puzzled.\\n\\n\"My mistake again. I thought you were saying how sorry you were about my\\ntail, being all numb, and could you do anything to help?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That wasn\\'t me,\" he said. He thought for a little and\\nthen suggested helpfully, \"Perhaps it was somebody else.\"\\n\\n\"Well, thank him for me when you see him.\"\\n\\nPooh looked anxiously at Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"Pooh\\'s found the North Pole,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Isn\\'t that\\nlovely?\"\\n\\nPooh looked modestly down.\\n\\n\"Is that it?\" said Eeyore.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"Is that what we were looking for?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Eeyore. \"Well, anyhow--it didn\\'t rain,\" he said.\\n\\nThey stuck the pole in the ground, and Christopher Robin tied a message\\non to it.\\n\\n                               NORTH POLE\\n\\n                           DISCOVERED BY POOH\\n\\n                             POOH FOUND IT.\\n\\nThen they all went home again. And I think, but I am not quite sure,\\nthat Roo had a hot bath and went straight to bed. But Pooh went back to\\nhis own house, and feeling very proud of what he had done, had a little\\nsomething to revive himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER IX\\n\\n                       IN WHICH PIGLET IS ENTIRELY\\n                           SURROUNDED BY WATER\\n\\n\\nIt rained and it rained and it rained. Piglet told himself that never\\nin all his life, and _he_ was goodness knows _how_ old--three, was it,\\nor four?--never had he seen so much rain. Days and days and days.\\n\\n\"If only,\" he thought, as he looked out of the window, \"I had been in\\nPooh\\'s house, or Christopher Robin\\'s house, or Rabbit\\'s house when it\\nbegan to rain, then I should have had Company all this time, instead of\\nbeing here all alone, with nothing to do except wonder when it will\\nstop.\" And he imagined himself with Pooh, saying, \"Did you ever see such\\nrain, Pooh?\" and Pooh saying, \"Isn\\'t it _awful_, Piglet?\" and Piglet\\nsaying, \"I wonder how it is over Christopher Robin\\'s way\" and Pooh\\nsaying, \"I should think poor old Rabbit is about flooded out by this\\ntime.\" It would have been jolly to talk like this, and really, it wasn\\'t\\nmuch good having anything exciting like floods, if you couldn\\'t share\\nthem with somebody.\\n\\nFor it was rather exciting. The little dry ditches in which Piglet had\\nnosed about so often had become streams, the little streams across which\\nhe had splashed were rivers, and the river, between whose steep banks\\nthey had played so happily, had sprawled out of its own bed and was\\ntaking up so much room everywhere, that Piglet was beginning to wonder\\nwhether it would be coming into _his_ bed soon.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a little Anxious,\" he said to himself, \"to be a Very Small Animal\\nEntirely Surrounded by Water. Christopher Robin and Pooh could escape by\\nClimbing Trees, and Kanga could escape by Jumping, and Rabbit could\\nescape by Burrowing, and Owl could escape by Flying, and Eeyore could\\nescape by--by Making a Loud Noise Until Rescued, and here am I,\\nsurrounded by water and I can\\'t do _anything_.\"\\n\\nIt went on raining, and every day the water got a little higher, until\\nnow it was nearly up to Piglet\\'s window ... and still he hadn\\'t done\\nanything.\\n\\n\"There\\'s Pooh,\" he thought to himself. \"Pooh hasn\\'t much Brain, but he\\nnever comes to any harm. He does silly things and they turn out right.\\nThere\\'s Owl. Owl hasn\\'t exactly got Brain, but he Knows Things. He would\\nknow the Right Thing to Do when Surrounded by Water. There\\'s Rabbit. He\\nhasn\\'t Learnt in Books, but he can always Think of a Clever Plan.\\nThere\\'s Kanga. She isn\\'t Clever, Kanga isn\\'t, but she would be so\\nanxious about Roo that she would do a Good Thing to Do without thinking\\nabout It. And then there\\'s Eeyore. And Eeyore is so miserable anyhow\\nthat he wouldn\\'t mind about this. But I wonder what Christopher Robin\\nwould do?\"\\n\\nThen suddenly he remembered a story which Christopher Robin had told him\\nabout a man on a desert island who had written something in a bottle and\\nthrown it in the sea; and Piglet thought that if he wrote something in a\\nbottle and threw it in the water, perhaps somebody would come and rescue\\n_him_!\\n\\nHe left the window and began to search his house, all of it that wasn\\'t\\nunder water, and at last he found a pencil and a small piece of dry\\npaper, and a bottle with a cork to it. And he wrote on one side of the\\npaper:\\n\\n                                 HELP!\\n                              PIGLET (ME)\\n\\nand on the other side:\\n\\n                       IT\\'S ME PIGLET, HELP HELP.\\n\\nThen he put the paper in the bottle, and he corked the bottle up as\\ntightly as he could, and he leant out of his window as far as he could\\nlean without falling in, and he threw the bottle as far as he could\\nthrow--_splash!_--and in a little while it bobbed up again on the water;\\nand he watched it floating slowly away in the distance, until his eyes\\nached with looking, and sometimes he thought it was the bottle, and\\nsometimes he thought it was just a ripple on the water which he was\\nfollowing, and then suddenly he knew that he would never see it again\\nand that he had done all that he could do to save himself.\\n\\n\"So now,\" he thought, \"somebody else will have to do something, and I\\nhope they will do it soon, because if they don\\'t I shall have to swim,\\nwhich I can\\'t, so I hope they do it soon.\" And then he gave a very long\\nsigh and said, \"I wish Pooh were here. It\\'s so much more friendly with\\ntwo.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nWhen the rain began Pooh was asleep. It rained, and it rained, and it\\nrained, and he slept and he slept and he slept. He had had a tiring day.\\nYou remember how he discovered the North Pole; well, he was so proud of\\nthis that he asked Christopher Robin if there were any other Poles such\\nas a Bear of Little Brain might discover.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a South Pole,\" said Christopher Robin, \"and I expect there\\'s an\\nEast Pole and a West Pole, though people don\\'t like talking about them.\"\\n\\nPooh was very excited when he heard this, and suggested that they should\\nhave an Expotition to discover the East Pole, but Christopher Robin had\\nthought of something else to do with Kanga; so Pooh went out to discover\\nthe East Pole by himself. Whether he discovered it or not, I forget; but\\nhe was so tired when he got home that, in the very middle of his supper,\\nafter he had been eating for little more than half-an-hour, he fell fast\\nasleep in his chair, and slept and slept and slept.\\n\\nThen suddenly he was dreaming. He was at the East Pole, and it was a\\nvery cold pole with the coldest sort of snow and ice all over it. He had\\nfound a bee-hive to sleep in, but there wasn\\'t room for his legs, so he\\nhad left them outside. And Wild Woozles, such as inhabit the East Pole,\\ncame and nibbled all the fur off his legs to make nests for their Young.\\nAnd the more they nibbled, the colder his legs got, until suddenly he\\nwoke up with an _Ow!_--and there he was, sitting in his chair with his\\nfeet in the water, and water all round him!\\n\\nHe splashed to his door and looked out....\\n\\n\"This is Serious,\" said Pooh. \"I must have an Escape.\"\\n\\nSo he took his largest pot of honey and escaped with it to a broad\\nbranch of his tree, well above the water, and then he climbed down again\\nand escaped with another pot ... and when the whole Escape was\\nfinished, there was Pooh sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and\\nthere, beside him, were ten pots of honey....\\n\\nTwo days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his\\nlegs, and there, beside him, were four pots of honey....\\n\\nThree days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his\\nlegs, and there beside him, was one pot of honey.\\n\\nFour days later, there was Pooh ...\\n\\nAnd it was on the morning of the fourth day that Piglet\\'s bottle came\\nfloating past him, and with one loud cry of \"Honey!\" Pooh plunged into\\nthe water, seized the bottle, and struggled back to his tree again.\\n\\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he opened it. \"All that wet for nothing. What\\'s\\nthat bit of paper doing?\"\\n\\nHe took it out and looked at it.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a Missage,\" he said to himself, \"that\\'s what it is. And that\\nletter is a \\'P,\\' and so is that, and so is that, and \\'P\\' means \\'Pooh,\\'\\nso it\\'s a very important Missage to me, and I can\\'t read it. I must find\\nChristopher Robin or Owl or Piglet, one of those Clever Readers who can\\nread things, and they will tell me what this missage means. Only I can\\'t\\nswim. Bother!\"\\n\\nThen he had an idea, and I think that for a Bear of Very Little Brain,\\nit was a good idea. He said to himself:\\n\\n\"If a bottle can float, then a jar can float, and if a jar floats, I can\\nsit on the top of it, if it\\'s a very big jar.\"\\n\\nSo he took his biggest jar, and corked it up. \"All boats have to have a\\nname,\" he said, \"so I shall call mine _The Floating Bear_.\" And with\\nthese words he dropped his boat into the water and jumped in after it.\\n\\nFor a little while Pooh and _The Floating Bear_ were uncertain as to\\nwhich of them was meant to be on the top, but after trying one or two\\ndifferent positions, they settled down with _The Floating Bear_\\nunderneath and Pooh triumphantly astride it, paddling vigorously with\\nhis feet.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nChristopher Robin lived at the very top of the Forest. It rained, and it\\nrained, and it rained, but the water couldn\\'t come up to _his_ house. It\\nwas rather jolly to look down into the valleys and see the water all\\nround him, but it rained so hard that he stayed indoors most of the\\ntime, and thought about things. Every morning he went out with his\\numbrella and put a stick in the place where the water came up to, and\\nevery next morning he went out and couldn\\'t see his stick any more, so\\nhe put another stick in the place where the water came up to, and then\\nhe walked home again, and each morning he had a shorter way to walk than\\nhe had had the morning before. On the morning of the fifth day he saw\\nthe water all round him, and knew that for the first time in his life he\\nwas on a real island. Which was very exciting.\\n\\nIt was on this morning that Owl came flying over the water to say \"How\\ndo you do,\" to his friend Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"I say, Owl,\" said Christopher Robin, \"isn\\'t this fun? I\\'m on an\\nisland!\"\\n\\n\"The atmospheric conditions have been very unfavourable lately,\" said\\nOwl.\\n\\n\"The what?\"\\n\\n\"It has been raining,\" explained Owl.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Christopher Robin. \"It has.\"\\n\\n\"The flood-level has reached an unprecedented height.\"\\n\\n\"The who?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a lot of water about,\" explained Owl.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Christopher Robin, \"there is.\"\\n\\n\"However, the prospects are rapidly becoming more favourable. At any\\nmoment----\"\\n\\n\"Have you seen Pooh?\"\\n\\n\"No. At any moment----\"\\n\\n\"I hope he\\'s all right,\" said Christopher Robin. \"I\\'ve been wondering\\nabout him. I expect Piglet\\'s with him. Do you think they\\'re all right,\\nOwl?\"\\n\\n\"I expect so. You see, at any moment----\"\\n\\n\"Do go and see, Owl. Because Pooh hasn\\'t got very much brain, and he\\nmight do something silly, and I do love him so, Owl. Do you see, Owl?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" said Owl. \"I\\'ll go. Back directly.\" And he flew off.\\n\\nIn a little while he was back again.\\n\\n\"Pooh isn\\'t there,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Not there?\"\\n\\n\"Has _been_ there. He\\'s been sitting on a branch of his tree outside his\\nhouse with nine pots of honey. But he isn\\'t there now.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Pooh!\" cried Christopher Robin. \"Where _are_ you?\"\\n\\n\"Here I am,\" said a growly voice behind him.\\n\\n\"Pooh!\"\\n\\nThey rushed into each other\\'s arms.\\n\\n\"How did you get here, Pooh?\" asked Christopher Robin, when he was ready\\nto talk again.\\n\\n\"On my boat,\" said Pooh proudly. \"I had a Very Important Missage sent me\\nin a bottle, and owing to having got some water in my eyes, I couldn\\'t\\nread it, so I brought it to you. On my boat.\"\\n\\nWith these proud words he gave Christopher Robin the missage.\\n\\n\"But it\\'s from Piglet!\" cried Christopher Robin when he had read it.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t there anything about Pooh in it?\" asked Bear, looking over his\\nshoulder.\\n\\nChristopher Robin read the message aloud.\\n\\n\"Oh, are those \\'P\\'s\\' piglets? I thought they were poohs.\"\\n\\n\"We must rescue him at once! I thought he was with _you_, Pooh. Owl,\\ncould you rescue him on your back?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think so,\" said Owl, after grave thought. \"It is doubtful if\\nthe necessary dorsal muscles----\"\\n\\n\"Then would you fly to him at _once_ and say that Rescue is Coming? And\\nPooh and I will think of a Rescue and come as quick as ever we can. Oh,\\ndon\\'t _talk_, Owl, go on quick!\" And, still thinking of something to\\nsay, Owl flew off.\\n\\n\"Now then, Pooh,\" said Christopher Robin, \"where\\'s your boat?\"\\n\\n\"I ought to say,\" explained Pooh as they walked down to the shore of the\\nisland, \"that it isn\\'t just an ordinary sort of boat. Sometimes it\\'s a\\nBoat, and sometimes it\\'s more of an Accident. It all depends.\"\\n\\n\"Depends on what?\"\\n\\n\"On whether I\\'m on the top of it or underneath it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Well, where is it?\"\\n\\n\"There!\" said Pooh, pointing proudly to _The Floating Bear_.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t what Christopher Robin expected, and the more he looked at it,\\nthe more he thought what a Brave and Clever Bear Pooh was, and the more\\nChristopher Robin thought this, the more Pooh looked modestly down his\\nnose and tried to pretend he wasn\\'t.\\n\\n\"But it\\'s too small for two of us,\" said Christopher Robin sadly.\\n\\n\"Three of us with Piglet.\"\\n\\n\"That makes it smaller still. Oh, Pooh Bear, what shall we do?\"\\n\\nAnd then this Bear, Pooh Bear, Winnie-the-Pooh, F.O.P. (Friend of\\nPiglet\\'s), R.C. (Rabbit\\'s Companion), P.D. (Pole Discoverer), E.C. and\\nT.F. (Eeyore\\'s Comforter and Tail-finder)--in fact, Pooh himself--said\\nsomething so clever that Christopher Robin could only look at him with\\nmouth open and eyes staring, wondering if this was really the Bear of\\nVery Little Brain whom he had known and loved so long.\\n\\n\"We might go in your umbrella,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"?\"\\n\\n\"We might go in your umbrella,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"? ?\"\\n\\n\"We might go in your umbrella,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"!!!!!!\"\\n\\nFor suddenly Christopher Robin saw that they might. He opened his\\numbrella and put it point downwards in the water. It floated but\\nwobbled. Pooh got in. He was just beginning to say that it was all right\\nnow, when he found that it wasn\\'t, so after a short drink which he\\ndidn\\'t really want he waded back to Christopher Robin. Then they both\\ngot in together, and it wobbled no longer.\\n\\n\"I shall call this boat _The Brain of Pooh_,\" said Christopher Robin,\\nand _The Brain of Pooh_ set sail forthwith in a south-westerly\\ndirection, revolving gracefully.\\n\\nYou can imagine Piglet\\'s joy when at last the ship came in sight of him.\\nIn after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very Great Danger\\nduring the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had really been in was\\nin the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when Owl, who had just flown\\nup, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him, and told him a very long\\nstory about an aunt who had once laid a seagull\\'s egg by mistake, and\\nthe story went on and on, rather like this sentence, until Piglet who\\nwas listening out of his window without much hope, went to sleep quietly\\nand naturally, slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until\\nhe was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment luckily, a sudden\\nloud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story, being what his\\naunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself\\nback into safety and say, \"How interesting, and did she?\" when--well,\\nyou can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship, _Brain of\\nPooh_ (_Captain_, C. Robin; _1st Mate_, P. Bear) coming over the sea to\\nrescue him. Christopher Robin and Pooh again....\\n\\nAnd that is really the end of the story, and I am very tired after that\\nlast sentence, I think I shall stop there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER X\\n\\n                    IN WHICH CHRISTOPHER ROBIN GIVES\\n                    POOH A PARTY, AND WE SAY GOOD-BYE\\n\\n\\nOne day when the sun had come back over the Forest, bringing with it\\nthe scent of may, and all the streams of the Forest were tinkling\\nhappily to find themselves their own pretty shape again, and the little\\npools lay dreaming of the life they had seen and the big things they had\\ndone, and in the warmth and quiet of the Forest the cuckoo was trying\\nover his voice carefully and listening to see if he liked it, and\\nwood-pigeons were complaining gently to themselves in their lazy\\ncomfortable way that it was the other fellow\\'s fault, but it didn\\'t\\nmatter very much; on such a day as this Christopher Robin whistled in a\\nspecial way he had, and Owl came flying out of the Hundred Acre Wood to\\nsee what was wanted.\\n\\n\"Owl,\" said Christopher Robin, \"I am going to give a party.\"\\n\\n\"You are, are you?\" said Owl.\\n\\n\"And it\\'s to be a special sort of party, because it\\'s because of what\\nPooh did when he did what he did to save Piglet from the flood.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s what it\\'s for, is it?\" said Owl.\\n\\n\"Yes, so will you tell Pooh as quickly as you can, and all the others,\\nbecause it will be to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it will, will it?\" said Owl, still being as helpful as possible.\\n\\n\"So will you go and tell them, Owl?\"\\n\\nOwl tried to think of something very wise to say, but couldn\\'t, so he\\nflew off to tell the others. And the first person he told was Pooh.\\n\\n\"Pooh,\" he said, \"Christopher Robin is giving a party.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. And then seeing that Owl expected him to say something\\nelse, he said \"Will there be those little cake things with pink sugar\\nicing?\"\\n\\nOwl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things\\nwith pink sugar icing, so he told Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin\\nhad said, and flew off to Eeyore.\\n\\n\"A party for Me?\" thought Pooh to himself. \"How grand!\" And he began to\\nwonder if all the other animals would know that it was a special Pooh\\nParty, and if Christopher Robin had told them about _The Floating Bear_\\nand the _Brain of Pooh_ and all the wonderful ships he had invented and\\nsailed on, and he began to think how awful it would be if everybody had\\nforgotten about it, and nobody quite knew what the party was for; and\\nthe more he thought like this, the more the party got muddled in his\\nmind, like a dream when nothing goes right. And the dream began to sing\\nitself over in his head until it became a sort of song. It was an\\n\\n                           ANXIOUS POOH SONG.\\n\\n    3 Cheers for Pooh!\\n    (_For Who?_)\\n    For Pooh--\\n    (_Why what did he do?_)\\n    I thought you knew;\\n    He saved his friend from a wetting!\\n    3 Cheers for Bear!\\n    (_For where?_)\\n    For Bear--\\n    He couldn\\'t swim,\\n    But he rescued him!\\n    (_He rescued who?_)\\n    Oh, listen, do!\\n    I am talking of Pooh--\\n    (_Of who?_)\\n    Of Pooh!\\n    (_I\\'m sorry I keep forgetting_).\\n    Well, Pooh was a Bear of Enormous Brain\\n    (_Just say it again!_)\\n    Of enormous brain--\\n    (_Of enormous what?_)\\n    Well, he ate a lot,\\n    And I don\\'t know if he could swim or not,\\n    But he managed to float\\n    On a sort of boat\\n    (_On a sort of what?_)\\n    Well, a sort of pot--\\n    So now let\\'s give him three hearty cheers\\n    (_So now let\\'s give him three hearty whiches?_)\\n    And hope he\\'ll be with us for years and years,\\n    And grow in health and wisdom and riches!\\n    3 Cheers for Pooh!\\n    (_For who?_)\\n    For Pooh--\\n    3 Cheers for Bear!\\n    (_For where?_)\\n    For Bear--\\n    3 Cheers for the wonderful Winnie-the-Pooh!\\n    (_Just tell me, somebody_--WHAT DID HE DO?)\\n\\nWhile this was going on inside him, Owl was talking to Eeyore.\\n\\n\"Eeyore,\" said Owl, \"Christopher Robin is giving a party.\"\\n\\n\"Very interesting,\" said Eeyore. \"I suppose they will be sending me down\\nthe odd bits which got trodden on. Kind and Thoughtful. Not at all,\\ndon\\'t mention it.\"\\n\\n\"There is an Invitation for you.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that like?\"\\n\\n\"An Invitation!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I heard you. Who dropped it?\"\\n\\n\"This isn\\'t anything to eat, it\\'s asking you to the party. To-morrow.\"\\n\\nEeyore shook his head slowly.\\n\\n\"You mean Piglet. The little fellow with the excited ears. That\\'s\\nPiglet. I\\'ll tell him.\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" said Owl, getting quite fussy. \"It\\'s you!\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I\\'m sure. Christopher Robin said \\'All of them! Tell all of\\nthem.\\'\"\\n\\n\"All of them, except Eeyore?\"\\n\\n\"All of them,\" said Owl sulkily.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Eeyore. \"A mistake, no doubt, but still, I shall come. Only\\ndon\\'t blame _me_ if it rains.\"\\n\\nBut it didn\\'t rain. Christopher Robin had made a long table out of some\\nlong pieces of wood, and they all sat round it. Christopher Robin sat at\\none end, and Pooh sat at the other, and between them on one side were\\nOwl and Eeyore and Piglet, and between them on the other side were\\nRabbit, and Roo and Kanga. And all Rabbit\\'s friends and relations spread\\nthemselves about on the grass, and waited hopefully in case anybody\\nspoke to them, or dropped anything, or asked them the time.\\n\\nIt was the first party to which Roo had ever been, and he was very\\nexcited. As soon as ever they had sat down he began to talk.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Pooh!\" he squeaked.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Roo!\" said Pooh.\\n\\nRoo jumped up and down in his seat for a little while and then began\\nagain.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Piglet!\" he squeaked.\\n\\nPiglet waved a paw at him, being too busy to say anything.\\n\\n\"Hallo, Eeyore!\" said Roo.\\n\\nEeyore nodded gloomily at him. \"It will rain soon, you see if it\\ndoesn\\'t,\" he said.\\n\\nRoo looked to see if it didn\\'t, and it didn\\'t, so he said \"Hallo,\\nOwl!\"--and Owl said \"Hallo, my little fellow,\" in a kindly way, and went\\non telling Christopher Robin about an accident which had nearly happened\\nto a friend of his whom Christopher Robin didn\\'t know, and Kanga said to\\nRoo, \"Drink up your milk first, dear, and talk afterwards.\" So Roo, who\\nwas drinking his milk, tried to say that he could do both at once ...\\nand had to be patted on the back and dried for quite a long time\\nafterwards.\\n\\nWhen they had all nearly eaten enough, Christopher Robin banged on the\\ntable with his spoon, and everybody stopped talking and was very silent,\\nexcept Roo who was just finishing a loud attack of hiccups and trying to\\nlook as if it was one of Rabbit\\'s relations.\\n\\n\"This party,\" said Christopher Robin, \"is a party because of what\\nsomeone did, and we all know who it was, and it\\'s his party, because of\\nwhat he did, and I\\'ve got a present for him and here it is.\" Then he\\nfelt about a little and whispered, \"Where is it?\"\\n\\nWhile he was looking, Eeyore coughed in an impressive way and began to\\nspeak.\\n\\n\"Friends,\" he said, \"including oddments, it is a great pleasure, or\\nperhaps I had better say it has been a pleasure so far, to see you at my\\nparty. What I did was nothing. Any of you--except Rabbit and Owl and\\nKanga--would have done the same. Oh, and Pooh. My remarks do not, of\\ncourse, apply to Piglet and Roo, because they are too small. Any of you\\nwould have done the same. But it just happened to be Me. It was not, I\\nneed hardly say, with an idea of getting what Christopher Robin is\\nlooking for now\"--and he put his front leg to his mouth and said in a\\nloud whisper, \"Try under the table\"--\"that I did what I did--but because\\nI feel that we should all do what we can to help. I feel that we should\\nall----\"\\n\\n\"H--hup!\" said Roo accidentally.\\n\\n\"Roo, dear!\" said Kanga reproachfully.\\n\\n\"Was it me?\" asked Roo, a little surprised.\\n\\n\"What\\'s Eeyore talking about?\" Piglet whispered to Pooh.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Pooh rather dolefully.\\n\\n\"I thought this was _your_ party.\"\\n\\n\"I thought it was _once_. But I suppose it isn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d sooner it was yours than Eeyore\\'s,\" said Piglet.\\n\\n\"So would I,\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"H--hup!\" said Roo again.\\n\\n\"AS--I--WAS--SAYING,\" said Eeyore loudly and sternly, \"as I was saying\\nwhen I was interrupted by various Loud Sounds, I feel that----\"\\n\\n\"Here it is!\" cried Christopher Robin excitedly. \"Pass it down to silly\\nold Pooh. It\\'s for Pooh.\"\\n\\n\"For Pooh?\" said Eeyore.\\n\\n\"Of course it is. The best bear in all the world.\"\\n\\n\"I might have known,\" said Eeyore. \"After all, one can\\'t complain. I\\nhave my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday. And was it last\\nweek or the week before that Rabbit bumped into me and said \\'Bother!\\'\\nThe Social Round. Always something going on.\"\\n\\nNobody was listening, for they were all saying \"Open it, Pooh,\" \"What is\\nit, Pooh?\" \"I know what it is,\" \"No, you don\\'t\" and other helpful\\nremarks of this sort. And of course Pooh was opening it as quickly as\\never he could, but without cutting the string, because you never know\\nwhen a bit of string might be Useful. At last it was undone.\\n\\nWhen Pooh saw what it was, he nearly fell down, he was so pleased. It\\nwas a Special Pencil Case. There were pencils in it marked \"B\" for Bear,\\nand pencils marked \"HB\" for Helping Bear, and pencils marked \"BB\" for\\nBrave Bear. There was a knife for sharpening the pencils, and\\nindia-rubber for rubbing out anything which you had spelt wrong, and a\\nruler for ruling lines for the words to walk on, and inches marked on\\nthe ruler in case you wanted to know how many inches anything was, and\\nBlue Pencils and Red Pencils and Green Pencils for saying special things\\nin blue and red and green. And all these lovely things were in little\\npockets of their own in a Special Case which shut with a click when you\\nclicked it. And they were all for Pooh.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\\n\\n\"Oh, Pooh!\" said everybody else except Eeyore.\\n\\n\"Thank-you,\" growled Pooh.\\n\\nBut Eeyore was saying to himself, \"This writing business. Pencils and\\nwhat-not. Over-rated, if you ask me. Silly stuff. Nothing in it.\"\\n\\nLater on, when they had all said \"Good-bye\" and \"Thank-you\" to\\nChristopher Robin, Pooh and Piglet walked home thoughtfully together in\\nthe golden evening, and for a long time they were silent.\\n\\n\"When you wake up in the morning, Pooh,\" said Piglet at last, \"what\\'s\\nthe first thing you say to yourself?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s for breakfast?\" said Pooh. \"What do _you_ say, Piglet?\"\\n\\n\"I say, I wonder what\\'s going to happen exciting _to-day_?\" said Piglet.\\n\\nPooh nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the same thing,\" he said.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"And what did happen?\" asked Christopher Robin.\\n\\n\"When?\"\\n\\n\"Next morning.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Could you think and tell me and Pooh some time?\"\\n\\n\"If you wanted it very much.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh does,\" said Christopher Robin.\\n\\nHe gave a deep sigh, picked his bear up by the leg and walked off to the\\ndoor, trailing Winnie-the-Pooh behind him. At the door he turned and\\nsaid \"Coming to see me have my bath?\"\\n\\n\"I might,\" I said.\\n\\n\"Was Pooh\\'s pencil case any better than mine?\"\\n\\n\"It was just the same,\" I said.\\n\\nHe nodded and went out ... and in a moment I heard\\nWinnie-the-Pooh--_bump, bump, bump_--going up the stairs behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                           Printed in Canada\\n                   by Warwick Bros. & Rutter, Limited\\n                        Printers and Bookbinders\\n                                Toronto\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note: Near the end of Chapter VI, the reference to\\nKanga was modified to read \"...and every Tuesday Kanga spent the day\\nwith her great friend Pooh ...\"]\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WINNIE-THE-POOH ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n']"
